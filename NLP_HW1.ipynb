              "'Introduction\\nI\\nThe Critique of Practical Reason , published in 1788, is the second of Kant’s\\nthree Critiques , falling between the Critique of Pure Reason (ﬁrst edition: 1781,\\nsecond edition: 1787) and the Critique of Judgment (1790). It is also the second\\nof his three major works devoted to moral theory, along with the Groundwork\\nof the Metaphysics of Morals (1785) and the Metaphysics of Morals (1797).\\nThese works develop an account of morality that reacts to those found in both\\nthe empiricist and the rationalist traditions, and together they constitute\\nKant ’s lasting contribution to moral theory.\\nCertain remarks in the Groundwork suggest that Kant did not originally\\nplan a separate critique of practical reason. He notes that although a critique\\nof practical reason is the only founda tion for a metaphysics of morals (i.e. a\\nsystematic classi ﬁcation of human duties on a priori grounds), the need for\\ncritique is less pressing in the case of practical reason than it is for speculative\\nreason, and that an outline of such a critique would suf ﬁce for his purposes.1\\nIn moral thought, ordinary r eason is more easily brought “to a high degree\\nof correctness and precision ”in that authoritative practical principles are\\nrevealed through the workings of ordinary moral consciousness, while in\\nits“pure but theoretical use, reason is wholly dialectical, ”tending to make\\nillusory and illegitimate metaphysical claims. Furthermore, executing a\\ncritique of practical reason would introduce complexities not absolutely\\nnecessary to a presentation of the basic principle of duty [ G4:391]. The\\nidea of writing a separate critique of practical reason appears to have\\noccurred to Kant while he was revising the Critique of Pure Reason for its\\nsecond edition.\\n1See Kant ’sGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals in the Practical Philosophy volume of the\\nCambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, trans. and ed. Mary Gregor (Cambridge\\nUniversity Press, 1996), hereafter G,4:391,445. The “outline ”is the Third Section of the\\nGroundwork , entitled “Transition from a Metaphysics of Morals to a Critique of Pure Practical\\nReason. ”References to Kant ’s works are included in the text and (with the exception of the\\nCritique of Pure Reason ) give the volume and page in the German Academy of Sciences edition of\\nKant ’s collected works, which are given in the margins of most English translations. Other\\nabbreviations and translations used are as follows:\\nCPR Critique of Pure Reason , trans. Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge University\\nPress, 1998).\\nMM The Metaphysics of Morals ,i nPractical Philosophy , trans. and ed. Mary Gregor (Cambridge\\nUniversity Press, 1996); also in Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy (Cambridge\\nUniversity Press, 1996).\\nReferences to the Critique of Practical Reason , also to the Academy paging, use no abbreviation.\\nviiDownload from:aghalibrary.comThe topics treated in the Critique of Practical Reason fall under three main\\nareas: moral theory, freedom of the will, and the doctrine of the “postulates\\nof pure practical reason, ”in which practical reason provides grounds for\\nassuming the reality of certain metaphysical ideas which could not be estab-\\nlished theoretically. The second Critique is a work of moral theory. But as\\nthis list of topics may indicate, it establishes important connections between\\nthemes that had been treated independently in the Groundwork and the\\nCritique of Pure Reason –in other words, between Kant’s moral theory and\\nhis epistemology and metaphysics. Or since Kant is never unconcerned with\\nsuch connections, it is more accurate to say that in the second Critique Kant\\nlays these connections out explicitly. In this respect, the second Critique makes\\nan essential contribution to the edi ﬁce of Kant ’s critical system. The fact that\\nit is a work of moral theory that puts some of the key elements of Kant’ s\\nsystem into place is one aspect of what Kant terms the “primacy of pure\\npractical reason. ”\\nBecause of the systematic nature of Kant’s concerns, it is dif ﬁcult to\\nappreciate the signiﬁ cance of certain themes in the second Critique without\\nsome familiarity with the Groundwork and the Critique of Pure Reason .T o\\nprovide some orientation to the Critique , this section surveys a few of its main\\nthemes and provides some, albeit cursory, background from these other\\nworks.\\nMoral theory\\nTheﬁrst major division of the Critique , its Analytic, presents some of the\\nfundamental ideas of Kant’s moral theory. For example, the opening chapter\\nprovides an analysis of the moral law as a principle that gives rise to objective\\nrequirements on action which are reason-giving simply in virtue of their\\nsuitability to serve as laws that any agent can regard as authoritative, without\\nappeal to an agent’s desires or interest in happiness, and which accordingly\\nregulates agents ’pursuit of their personal ends. The two chapters of the\\nAnalytic that follow take up the idea of the good as the “object of practical\\nreason ”and respect for the moral law as the motivation to moral conduct. In\\nChapter 2, Kant explains the “paradox of method ”to which his analysis of\\nmorality has led him [63 ]. Traditionally moral theories had accounted for\\nthe content of morality by ﬁrst assuming a conception of the good taken to be\\nself-evident, or which human beings are generally disposed to desire, and\\nthen deriving principles of conduct from this antecedent conception of the\\ngood. But Kant argues that in order to support the idea that moral require-\\nments apply with rational necessity, a moral theory must ﬁrst identify a law or\\nprinciple to which any rational agent is committed simply in virtue of possess-\\ning reason and will, and subsequently de ﬁne the good as that which one wills\\nunder the direction of this principle. What is morally good –the actions, ends,\\nand states of affairs which are the objects of good willing –is to be speci ﬁedIntroduction\\nviiiDownload from:aghalibrary.comby the application of this law. Chapter 3expa nds upon a long footnote in\\ntheGroundwork [G4:401n] on respect for the moral law as the proper moral\\nmotive.\\nWhile these discussions develop ideas presented in the Groundwork ,\\ntheCritique of Practical Reason takes a somewhat different approach to the\\njustiﬁcation of the moral law. The Groundwork separates this task into two\\nstages, and in the second attempts to establish the validity of the moral law by\\nderiving it from a conception of freedom that is independent of moral con-\\nsciousness. The ﬁrst two chapters of the Groundwork use an analysis of the\\nconcept of duty to arrive at a statement of the basic principle of duty, but stop\\nshort of showing that we ought to endorse this principle. The formal justi ﬁ-\\ncation of the validity of the moral law, which Kant refers to as its “deduction ”\\n[G4:454], is left to the third chapter. Here Kant tries to show that it is fully\\nrational to accept the moral law as our basic principle of conduct by deriving it\\nfrom a conception of freedom that we are warranted in attributing to ourselves\\non grounds that are independent of morality. The argument is notoriously\\nobscure, but roughly, it employs a set of analytical claims that connect freedom\\nwith morality, and rational agency with freedom, and then holds that our\\npossessing theoretical reason, which is a capacity for spontaneous activity,\\nwarrants us in regarding ourselves as rational agents in the sense required by\\nhis argument. Since we identify with our capacity for free and spontaneous\\nagency and regard it as our “proper self, ”we are committed to accepting the\\nauthority of its fundamental principle, the moral law.2However, in the Critique\\nKant argues that the moral law neither allows of nor needs a deduction in his\\ntechnical sense, but that its authority is ﬁrmly established in ordinary moral\\nconsciousness as a “fact of reason. ”[See, e.g. 31,46–50.] On reﬂection we do\\naccept the moral law as an authoritative standard of conduct that provides\\nsufﬁcient and overriding reasons for action and we are motivated to act by our\\njudgments of what it requires. We realize that we can do something because we\\njudge that it is our duty, even when it involves setting aside or foregoing\\nsubstantial desire-based interests, and we are disposed to self-criticism and\\nself-contempt when we fail to. Whether it is reasonable to accept the\\n2That theoretical reason is a capacity for spontaneous activity is shown by the fact that it\\nformulates ideas that outrun anything given by sensibility, through which it prescribes ends to\\nthe understanding that the understanding cannot form for itself. Kant appears to argue here that\\na rational being who regards himself as possessing this kind of intelligence must regard himself as\\nhaving the same capacity for spontaneity in his agency.

In\\nclaiming that the validity of the moral law is given as a “fact of reason, ”Kant\\nholds that it cannot and need not be grounded in anything outside of our\\nordinary moral consciousness, in which we are directly aware of the law-giving\\nactivity of reason.\\nFreedom of the will\\nTheCritique ’ssecond general area of concern is, in a sense, just another aspect\\nof theﬁrst. Kant claims to provide a proof of a strong notion of human\\nfreedom –that is, to establish the reality of transcendental freedom, according\\nto which the human will is a capacity for spontaneous activity, or a kind of\\ncausal power, which is independent of determination by empirical conditions.\\nThe possibility of transcendental freedom as a causality which is undeter-\\nmined by antecedent causal conditions had been of concern to Kant in the\\nCritique of Pure Reason , and important components of his account of free will\\nare developed there. Since Kant’ s theory of free will draws on the epistemo-\\nlogy of the ﬁrstCritique , it will be useful to mention some of its principal\\ndoctrines here. First, Kant’s transcendental idealism holds that space and\\ntime are not mind-independent features of reality, but structural features of\\nexperience speci ﬁc to human cognition; they are the “forms of intuition, ”or\\nthe forms of human perception. The fact that our experience has structural\\nfeatures that are due to our cognitive faculties introduces a distinction between\\nobjects as they appear to us ( “appearances” or“phenomena ”) and objects as\\nthey are in themselves, considered apart from the conditions under which they\\nappear ( “things-in-themselves ”or“noumena ”). Second, we should recall\\nKant ’s view that two different elements of cognition, intuitions and concepts,\\nare required for synthetic knowledge. Intuitions are singular representations\\nthrough which material is presented to the mind, while concepts are general\\nrepresentations originating in the spontaneous activity of the understanding.\\nThe act of bringing intuitions under a concept in a judgment, through which\\nthe manifold of intuition is uni ﬁed and brought to consciousness, is what gives\\nrise to knowledge.\\nThese elements of Kant ’s epistemology have several important consequen-\\nces. First, the spatio-temporal properties of objects and the laws governing\\nspatio-temporal events do not characterize things in themselves, but objects\\nas they appear. Since synthetic knowledge presupposes some intuition, which in\\nus is always spatio-temporal, our knowledge is limited to objects as they appear\\nin space and time; there is no knowledge of things in themselves, which cannot\\nbe given in intuition. This analysis of the conditions and limits of knowledge\\nentails the impossibility of a certain kind of metaphysics. Traditionally meta-\\nphysics had sought a priori demonstrative knowledge of transcendent facts\\nsuch as the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the principles\\nof cosmology. But if these lie beyond the limits of experience (as the traditionIntroduction\\nxagreed), they are beyond human knowledge. Moreover, claims about such\\ntranscendent facts are synthetic. Kant argues that metaphysics had been\\nattempting to establish its conclusions through inferences from purely concep-\\ntual premises. Since no such deductive argument can establish any synthetic\\nclaim, metaphysics could not produce the kind of knowledge which it sought.\\nFinally, while Kant ’s epistemology undermines traditional metaphysics, it\\nunexpectedly creates the possibility in principle of making assertions about\\nwhat lies beyond experience, should we ﬁnd sufﬁcient grounds for doing so.\\nThe distinction between appearances and things in themselves, along with the\\nclaim that spatio-temporal properties and laws do not represent objects as they\\nare in themselves, creates room for the thought of noumenal objects subject\\nto laws that are different in kind from those governing spatio-temporal events.\\nMerely thinking about noumenal objects is not knowledge, of course, and the fact\\nthat we may coherently entertain such th oughts does not license any assertions\\nabout noumenal objects. But since nothing can be known about what is not part\\nof the spatio-temporal framework, ther e can be no disproof of any (purported)\\nnoumenal object. Thus, propositions about noumenal objects cannot be contra-\\ndicted by any valid theoretical knowledge claim. Therefore while transcendental\\nidealism insists that there can be no know ledge of any noumenal entities, it does\\nso in a way that creates room for the thought of such entities and guarantees that\\npropositions about them are not incon sistent with theoretical knowledge.\\nReturning now to freedom, in the “Antinomy of Pure Reason ”Kant had\\nargued that in its theoretical use reason is led to the concept of transcendental\\nfreedom by the demand for completeness in explanation. We explain events\\nin nature by tracing them back to their causes –to antecedent conditions that\\nare jointly necessary and suf ﬁcient for their occurrence. But since the causes\\nof any given event themselves admit of explanation in terms of antecedent\\nconditions, the demand for explanation sets up the task of reconstructing\\nthe chain of antecedent causes. It is natural to think that the search for\\nexplanations is only completed when it identi ﬁes an event at the beginning\\nof the causal series whose occurrence is not determined by any antecedent\\nconditions and therefore needs no explanation. In this way, the demand for\\ncompleteness in explanation, which issues from the activity that is constitutive\\nof the theoretical use of reason, leads to the abstract idea of a transcendentally\\nfree cause. But Kant had also shown that everything in nature has a cause by\\narguing that any event that is a possible object of experience for us must stand\\nin causal relations to prior events, which ﬁx its location in a uni ﬁed spatio-\\ntemporal order. The concept of a transcendentally free cause violates one of\\nthe conditions of the unity of experience. Thus, the law of natural causality\\nrules out the possibility of encountering instances of transcendental freedom\\nin our experience of the natural world.3\\n3This paragraph draws on Henry E. Allison, Kant ’s Theory of Freedom , pp. 11–28.Introduction\\nxiIn the resolution of the Third Antinomy, Kant argues that transcendental\\nfreedom is at least possible in the sense that it is not inconsistent with universal\\nnatural causation. The distinction between appearances and things-in-\\nthemselves opens up the possibility that events that are subject to causal\\ndetermination when viewed as phenomena, may, when viewed as noumena,\\nmanifest free causality. For example, human actions, viewed as phenomenal\\nevents in the natural world, are explained by tracing their occurrence to\\nantecedent conditions from which they follow with necessity. But when\\nconsidered as noumena, it may be possible to regard them as resulting from\\ntranscendentally free causality. By this route Kant ’s transcendental idealism\\ncreates room for the idea of transcendental freedom. However, the claim that\\nthere is no inconsistency in viewing, say, human actions as the results of free\\ncausality falls far short of giving us positive warrant for doing so. The obvious\\nquestion at this point is whether we have any grounds for regarding human\\nactions as transcendentally free, and no such grounds can be supplied by\\ntheoretical reason. In its tasks of explaining the natural world and extending\\nempirical knowledge, it is bound to apply the principle of causality to all events.\\nIndeed, since Kant ’s resolution of the Third Antinomy does not modify the\\nargument for the law of natural causality, the impossibility of encountering\\nany instances of transcendental freedom in our experience of the natural world\\nremains. Thus the Critique of Pure Reason leaves theoretical reason in the\\nsituation of having demonstrated the consistency of the idea of transcendental\\nfreedom, but of being precluded from asserting its reality.\\nThe second Critique claims that grounds for ascribing transcendental free-\\ndom to ourselves are supplied by the practical use of reason. Since the moral\\nlaw provides reasons for action that are independent of the content and strength\\nof our desires, and which can require one to set aside or override desire-based\\nreasons, the ability to act from the moral law –the ability to do something\\nsimply because we judge that it is a duty –reveals in us an ability to act\\nindependently of determination by empirical conditions. But that is to say\\nthat the ability to act from the moral law reveals in us a kind of causality that\\nsatisﬁes the deﬁnition of transcendental freedom. Thus the fact of reason, in\\nwhich we recognize the authority of and are aware of our ability to act from the\\nmoral law, discloses our freedom. The moral law, as Kant says, “proves not only\\nthe possibility but the reality [of freedom] in beings who cognize this law as\\nbinding upon them ”[47].\\nThere are several points to note here, to which Kant draws our attention\\nin various places. First and most obvious, Kant holds that the practical use of\\nreason is able to give objective reality to an idea which reason in its theoretical\\nuse had to assume as possible, but could not establish. Moreover, practical\\nreason does more than provide grounds for the abstract claim that there is\\ntranscendentally free causality; it supplies a determinate statement of the law\\nthat governs such causality, namely the moral law [ 47–50,105]. Second, the\\nreality that Kant asserts for transcendental freedom is “objective ...thoughIntroduction\\nxiionly practical ”[49], and is not an illicit extension of theoretical knowledge\\nbeyond the limits of possible experience. Since the reality of transcendental\\nfreedom is not established through any sensible intuition, it is not an item\\nof empirical or theoretical knowledge that, for example, can enter into the\\nexplanation of events. The grounds for ascribing freedom to ourselves come\\nfrom our recognition of the authority of moral norms, and this ascription is\\nmade for practical purposes, as part of our self-conception as rational agents.\\nThird, whereas in the Groundwork Kant appears to believe that we must\\nhave grounds for ascribing transcendental freedom to ourselves before we\\ncan establish the authority of the moral law, the second Critique reverses this\\norder: here Kant argues that it is the authority of the moral law that reveals our\\nfreedom. Kant notes that “whereas freedom is indeed the ratio essendi of the\\nmoral law, the moral law is the ratio cognoscendi of freedom ”[4n]. Finally, the\\nfact that the authority of the moral law establishes the reality of transcendental\\nfreedom serves as a further “credential ”[Kreditiv ] for the moral law [ 48].\\nThat the moral law provides grounds for assuming the reality of an idea that\\nhad remained problematic for reason in its theoretical use, and in this way\\ncontributes to the construction of Kant’ s philosophical system, is a further\\nconﬁrmation of its authority that takes the place of a formal deduction.\\nThe postulates of pure practical reason\\nThe Dialectic of the second Critique argues that certain necessary moral\\ninterests authorize us to assume the existence of God and the immortality of\\nthe soul as “postulates of pure practical reason. ”These postulates are the\\nelements of a “rational faith ”or“reasonable faith ”[Vernunftglaube],4to which\\nKant refers in his remark that he has “found it necessary to destroy knowledge\\nin order to make room for faith ”[CPR Bxxx]. Kant argues that the moral law\\ngenerates a duty to do all we can to bring about the highest good in the world,\\nwhich for now we may understand as the state of affairs in which the ends of\\nmorality are realized in their totality. But the only way in which we can regard\\nthe highest good as a practical possibility is by assuming the immortality of\\nthe soul and the existence of God as a moral author of the universe who has\\nordered the world so as to support the ends of morality. Since the duty to\\nmake the highest good our end is unconditional, it licenses us to postulate the\\nexistence of God and the immortality of the soul, as conditions of the practical\\n4Kant refers to both a “pure rational faith ”[reiner Vernunftglaube ][126]a n da “pure practical\\nrational faith ”[144,146].Glaube maybe translated both as “faith ”and as “belief. ”Mary Gregor\\nrenders Vernunftglaube as“rational belief ”in this translation, while Lewis White Beck uses\\n“rational faith, ”“faith of pure practical reason, ”or even “practical faith. ”John Rawls suggests\\nthe term “reasonable faith ”to capture the idea of faith supported by reason. See “Themes in Kant ’s\\nMoral Philosophy, ”in Eckart Förster, ed., Kant ’s Transcendental Deductions (Stanford: Stanford\\nUniversity Press, 1989), p. 94,a n dLectures on the History of Moral Philosophy (Cambridge, MA:\\nHarvard University Press, 2000), pp. 309,319.Introduction\\nxiiipossibility of the highest good. We consider this argument in more detail in\\nthe last section.\\nAs with the idea of freedom, practical reason, in grounding the postulates,\\nresolves questions that reason in its theoretical use raises, but cannot answer.\\nIn theﬁrstCritique , Kant had argued that in its search for the ultimate ground\\nof all items given in experience –a problem given to reason “by the very\\nnature of reason itself ”[CPR Avii] –reason is led to the idea of God as the\\nultimate ground of all that exists and to the idea of the soul as a simple\\nsubstance that is the real subject of experience, and attempts to infer their\\nreality. The Dialectic of the ﬁrstCritique exposes the purely “dialectical ”or\\nillusory nature of these inferences, arguing that they draw synthetic conclu-\\nsions from purely conceptual premises and that the reality of such objects\\ncannot be established on theoretical grounds since they cannot be given in\\nintuition. By the same token, neither can their reality be disproved. Thus in its\\ntheoretical use, reason may inquire into the objective reality of these ideas, but\\nmust remain agnostic. As we have seen, Kant ’s transcendental idealism creates\\nroom for the thought of noumenal objects, and the limits on cognition that\\nplace such objects beyond knowledge guarantee that assertions of their reality\\nwill not contradict any theoretical claim. This permits the argument that\\npractical reason ’s need to support the rationality of adopting the highest\\ngood as our end is a positive ground for assuming the existence of God and\\nthe immortality of the soul. Since the warrant for these assertions comes from\\na need of practical reason rather than from any sensible intuition, they do not\\nextend theoretical knowledge.\\nII\\nOne might ask how these diverse topics all ﬁnd their way into a “critique ”of\\npractical reason. An answer to this question requires that we lay out the\\nmain lines of argument of the Critique. To begin, it may help to say something\\nabout the idea of “critique ”as Kant understands it, and about the distinction\\nbetween the theoretical and practical uses of reason.\\nA“critique ”is a critical examination of reason by itself, whose purpose is to\\nestablish the powers and limits of a use of reason, and in particular to establish\\nthe validity and legitimate employment of those a priori concepts and principles\\nwhich structure a domain of rational activity. The Prefaces of the Critique of Pure\\nReason make clear that its driving concern is with reason ’sc l a i m st oap r i o r i\\nknowledge of the world, and Kant remarks that a critique “will institute a court\\nof justice, by which reason may secure its rightful claims, while dismissing all its\\ngroundless pretensions ”[CPR Axi]. In the process, the ﬁrstCritique examines\\nall the cognitive faculties which claim to be sources of synthetic a priori knowl-\\nedge –sensibility, understanding, and reason in its theoretical use.\\nThe division of the Transcendental Logic into an Analytic and a Dialectic\\nindicates that critique has both a positive, justi ﬁcatory task and a negative,Introduction\\nxivcritical task. The main task of the Analytic is to establish the validity of the\\npure concepts of the understanding (the categories) in their application to\\nexperience and to derive the a priori principles of the understanding, which\\nare rules for the employment of the categories. The Dialectic demonstrates\\nthat reason ’s claims to knowledge of transcendent entities are groundless by\\nexposing the illusory inferences on which they are based, which in the case\\nof the Antinomies lead to apparent contradictions that threaten the coherence\\nof reason. However, assigning the task of justi ﬁcation to the Analytic and\\ncriticism to the Dialectic oversimpli ﬁes. Since the limitations imposed on\\nreason follow directly from the positive epistemological accomplishments of\\nthe Analytic, it serves an obvious critical function. And while the Dialectic\\ndemonstrates that the ideas of reason provide no speculative knowledge, it also\\nshows that they have a legitimate regulative role in guiding the employment\\nof the understanding. Reason prescribes aims of completeness and systematic\\nunity to the understanding which it cannot form for itself. The ideas of reason\\nset out these ideals, and are the source of maxims and regulative principles that\\nserve as norms for empirical inquiry and the extension of empirical knowl-\\nedge. Thus, the Dialectic validates the ideas of reason through their role in\\nextending and systematizing empirical knowledge, and shows that the proper\\ntheoretical use of reason is its normative function of guiding empirical inquiry.\\nWhile the theoretical use of reason is concerned with knowledge of objects,\\npractical reason is concerned with the “determining grounds of the will ”[15].\\nKant characterizes the will in different ways in his corpus, but throughout he\\nunderstands it as a causal power particular to rational agents. In the Groundwork ,\\nhe refers to the will both as “the capacity to act according to the representation of\\nlaws, i.e., according to principles ”and as “a kind of causality of living beings\\nin so far as they are rational ”[G4:412,446]. Similar characterizations of the\\nwill appear in the Critique , for example as the power to produce objects in\\naccordance with representations of those objects or as the power to act\\naccording to the representation of rules or principles.5In some important\\n5At15Kant characterizes the will as:\\na faculty either of producing objects corresponding to representations or of determining itself to\\neffect such objects (whether the physical power is suf ﬁcient or not), that is, of determining its\\ncausality ...[cf. also 45,60, and CPR Bix–x].\\nAnd at 32he refers to the will as:\\nthe ability to determine [one ’s] causality by the representation of rules, hence insofar as they are\\ncapable of actions in accordance with principles and consequently in accordance with a priori\\npractical principles.\\nKant ’s conception of the will is complicated by a distinction that he draws in the Metaphysics of\\nMorals between “will” [Wille ] and “the capacity for choice ”[Willkür ]. Willkür is“the faculty of\\ndesire in accordance with concepts ”(the rational faculty of desire) “insofar as it is joined with one ’s\\nconsciousness of the ability to bring about its object by one ’s actions. ”Wille is“the capacity for\\ndesire considered not so much in relation to the action (as Willkür is) but rather in relation to the\\nground determining choice to action ”[MM 6:213]. One way to interpret this distinction is that\\nWille refers to the capacity to deliberate about grounds of choice, or to determine whether an\\naction or end is good or supported by reason, while Willkür is the capacity to act on the basis ofIntroduction\\nxvpassages, Kant identi ﬁes the will with practical reason: “since reason is\\nrequired for deriving actions from laws, the will is nothing other than\\npractical reason ”[G4:412;s e ea l s o MM 6:213]. While Kant ’s conception\\nof the will de ﬁes simple de ﬁnition, this much seems clear. He understands\\nthe will to be a complex capacity found in rational agents to act on the basis\\nof principles or judgments about what is good, and it has different aspects. It\\nis a rational capacity –a capacity to reason about action and to determine\\nwhether an action or end is supported by reason, thus worth choosing. And it\\nis a causal power –the capacity to guide one’ s choices by such judgments, or\\nas Kant often says, the power to realize actions and ends represented as good\\nby means of those representations.6Thus the will is the capacity to guide\\none’s choice of ends and actions by the application to one’ s circumstances of\\nvarious rational principles (ranging, for example, from formal principles of\\nrationality to substantive practical principles). In saying that practical reason\\nis concerned with the determining grounds of the will, Kant is saying that it\\nis concerned with the basic principles governing deliberation and choice,\\nthrough which agents determine what they have most reason to do. Thus, as\\nwe will see, one aim of a critique of practical reason is to establish the basic\\nprinciples of practical reasoning. As the second Critique also has an Analytic\\nand a Dialectic, we should expect it to have both justi ﬁcatory and critical\\naims, though these aims map onto the division into Analytic and Dialectic\\neven less neatly than they do in the ﬁrstCritique.\\nThe next section outlines the central line of argument in Chapter I of the\\nAnalytic, Section IV comments brie ﬂy on the main ideas of Chapters II and III\\nof the Analytic, and the last section sketches the main themes of the Dialectic.\\nIII\\nIn both the Preface and Introduction, Kant notes that this work is not a\\ncritiqu\\ne of pure practical reason, but rather a critique of “reason ’s entire\\npractical faculty ”[3]o r “only of practical reason as such ”[15]. Since the\\npractical use of reason is concerned with the principles governing grounds of\\nchoice, the ﬁrst question which the Critique must answer is “whether pure\\nreason of itself alone suf ﬁces to determine the will or whether it can be a\\nsuch determinations. Henry Allison observes that “Kant uses the terms Willkür andWille to\\ncharacterize respectively the legislative and executive functions of a uni ﬁed faculty of volition,\\nwhich he likewise refers to as Wille ”[Kant ’s Theory of Freedom ,p .129]. Kant appears to use Wille\\nin this inclusive sense in the Groundwork and the second Critique . (For discussion see Allison,\\npp. 129–36.) Recently Stephen Engstrom has suggested that the distinction between Wille\\nandWillkür tracks the distinction between the cognitive or rational and the causal aspects of\\nvolition (that the will is both a rational capacity and a causal power). See Stephen Engstrom,\\n“Reason, Desire, and the Will, ”in Lara Denis, ed., Kant ’sMetaphysics of Morals : A Critical\\nGuide (Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010).\\n6See9n and MM 6:211, where Kant de ﬁnes the “faculty of desire ”as“the faculty to be by means\\nof its representations the cause of the reality of the objects of those representations. ”The will is a\\n“rational faculty of desire. ”Introduction\\nxv\\nidetermining ground of the will only as empirically conditioned ”[15]. What is\\nat stake in this question and why does Kant insist that pure practical reason\\nneeds no critique?\\nAt issue is a fundamental question about the nature of practical rationality\\nover which moral theorists have long divided. Hume famously claimed that\\n“Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can pretend to\\nno other of ﬁce than to serve and obey them. ”7Hume and other empiricists\\nargue for an instrumental conception of practical reason, which comprises\\na cluster of theses about motivation and the role of reason in deliberation.\\nEmpiricists hold that motives and reasons for action must ultimately be based\\non desires or basic preferences that are not themselves produced by reasoning,\\nwhich an agent has as a matter of psychological fact. Reason has the limited\\nfunction of prescribing the means to one ’s ends, seeking consistency among\\none’s desires, forming a conception of one ’s overall happiness in light of one ’s\\ndesires, and so forth. Desires and actions are subject to rational assessment\\nonly in terms of their consistency with other desires and ends, or with one ’s\\noverall happiness. There are no principles of reason which prescribe the\\nadoption of any ﬁnal ends or values, nor any rational grounds on which to\\nassess the intrinsic goodness of actions or ends. Practical reason, so conceived,\\nis“empirically conditioned ”in Kant’s terms, because the reasons that an agent\\nhas for acting are based on empirically given desires, which agents may,\\nwithout irrationality, lack.\\nTo hold that pure reason is practical is to deny that the empirically\\nconditioned use of practical reason is the only form of practical reason, and\\nto hold that reason by itself provides grounds suf ﬁcient to determine choice.\\nOtherwise put, it is to hold that reason prescribes practical principles whose\\nnormative force is not based on desire, but which apply to any agent simply in\\nvirtue of possessing reason and will. These principles provide a basis for\\nevaluating desires, ends, and actions for their inherent conformity to reason\\nrather than on instrumental grounds (e.g. in terms of their contribution to an\\nagent ’s happiness); and they yield grounds of choice that may take priority\\nover an agent ’s given desires and ends. Since they have necessary normative\\nforce for all rational agents, Kant terms them “practical laws. ”\\nThe question, “Does reason by itself provide grounds suf ﬁcient to deter-\\nmine the will? ”may appear ambiguous between two different questions:\\n(a) Can reason by itself motivate action? and (b) Does reason by itself generate\\n(non-instrumental) practical principles or requirements on conduct? Kant,\\nhowever, would not allow a sharp separation between these latter questions,\\nand his question includes both. His conception of rational agents is that\\nthey are motivated by what they take to be good reasons for action, and that\\n7Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature , ed. L. A. Selby-Bigge, revised by P. H. Nidditch (Oxford:\\nClarendon Press, 1978), p. 415.Introduction\\nxv\\niijustifying reasons have motivational force for rational agents.8If reason gen-\\nerates non-instrumental practical principles, then reason alone can motivate\\naction, and vice versa. Thus to resolve whether reason alone can determine the\\nwill it is enough to show that reason by itself generates practical principles, or\\npractical laws. Kant assumes this task at the outset of the Analytic, and proceeds\\nin Chapter I to establish the “Fundamental Law of Pure Practical Reason, ”\\nwhich he takes to be the basic principle of morality –the Categorical Imperative.\\nIf pure reason is practical, then it is empirical practical reason which needs\\ncritique in the negative sense –a critique that is carried out by pure practical\\nreason. Kant notes that it is “incumbent ”upon the Critique “to prevent\\nempirically conditioned reason from presuming that it, alone and exclusively,\\nfurnishes the determining ground of the will ”[16]. The “presumption ”of\\nempirical practical reason which Kant has in mind may be the natural ten-\\ndency to give priority to reasons based in one ’s personal interests –as, for\\nexample, is seen in someone who honors his obligations to others, or takes\\ntheir needs into account, only on the condition that it does not interfere too\\nmuch with his getting what he wants. This tendency might be reinforced by\\na view which may initially seem theoretically plausible, that all grounds of\\nchoice are ultimately desire-based. Implicit in both this tendency and this\\ntheoretical position is the claim that desire-based interests are sources of\\nsufﬁcient reasons –that, for example, the fact that empirical practical reason\\nidentiﬁes an action as conducive to one’s overall happiness is always a decisive\\nreason in its favor that settles what to do. It is precisely this sort of claim that\\nthe moral law deems illegitimate.9The moral law sets out a condition of\\nuniversalizability (speci ﬁed by the Categorical Imperative) that ends and actions\\n8This is not to say that rational agents are always motivated by objectively good reasons for\\naction, but only that they are motivated by considerations that they take to provide good reasons\\n(but which may not actually justify). Nor is it to say that suf ﬁcient reasons are always effective\\nmotives which lead to action, but only that they have some motivational force. For discussion of\\nthis aspect of Kant ’s conception of agency, see Christine M. Korsgaard, Creating the Kingdom of\\nEnds, ch. 4, esp. section iii; Andrews Reath, “Kant ’s Theory of Moral Sensibility, ”reprinted in\\nAgency and Autonomy in Kant ’s Moral Theory (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press,\\n2006), (especially Section IV and Appendix); and Henry E. Allison, Kant ’s Theory of Freedom ,\\npp.85–94,125–26. For a more recent discussion, see Reath, “Did Kant Hold that Rational\\nVolition is Sub Ratione Boni ?,”in Robert Johnson and Mark Timmons, eds., Kantian Themes from\\nthe Philosophy of Thomas E. Hill, Jr. (Oxford/New York: Oxford University Press, 2015).\\n9This “presumption ”of empirical practical reason is also mentioned in various forms in the\\nGroundwork . See, for example, the reference to a “natural dialectic, i.e., a propensity to quibble\\nwith these strict laws of duty ”and to bend them to one ’s wishes [ G4:405], as well as the tendency\\nto make exceptions to moral principles which one otherwise wills as universal laws “to the\\nadvantage of our inclination ”[G4:424]. Also relevant are Kant ’s characterizations of “self-\\nlove ”and “self-conceit, ”in Ch. iiiof the Analytic [ 73–76]. Self-love is a natural tendency to take\\none’s inclinations as good reasons for action. Self-conceit is the tendency to claim a special worth\\nfor one ’s person that does not recognize the limits on what is worthy of choice set by morality, in\\nvirtue of which one takes reasons stemming from self-love to be overriding reasons for action.\\nThese are tendencies of “our pathologically determinable self, even though it is un ﬁt to give\\nuniversal law through its maxims, nevertheless striving antecedently to make its claims primary\\nand originally valid, just as if it constituted our entire self ”[74]. Worth noting here is Kant ’s viewIntroduction\\nxv\\niiimust satisfy to be permissibly adopted. Actions that advance one ’s desire-based\\ninterests are fully choiceworthy only when they conform to the requirements of\\nmorality, and respect for the moral law checks the tendency to treat our desire-\\nbased interests as suf ﬁcient reasons.10By establishing the fundamental princi-\\nple of pure practical reason, the Analytic thus performs the critical task of\\nsetting limits to the employment of empirical practical reason. Pure practical\\nreason needs no critique in this sense since it “proves its reality ...by what it\\ndoes ”[3], and since it serves as the ﬁnal standard for assessing the choicewor-\\nthiness of desire-based interests [ 15].\\nLet us now turn to the main argument in Chapter I, which Kant organizes as\\na series of theorems and corollaries that follow from the de ﬁnition of a practical\\nlaw, leading to the claim that pure reason is practical and concluding that the\\nmoral law is a principle of autonomy. Kant de ﬁnes practical laws as principles\\nof conduct that give reasons for action to all agents just insofar as they have\\nreason and will, without depending on any contingent interests that distinguish\\none rational agent from another. In the ensuing sections, Kant derives from this\\ndeﬁnition further conditions that a principle must satisfy to qualify as a law.\\n“Theorem I ”introduces the concept of a “material practical principle” and\\nclaims that no such principles provide practical laws. A material practical\\nprinciple is a principle that “presupposes an object (matter) of the faculty of\\ndesire as the determining ground of the will ”[21]. This remark deserves some\\ncomment. A material practical principle is not simply a principle that directs\\nan agent to some object or end. Since Kant thinks that every action-guiding\\nprinciple contains an end, the concept would be of no interest if that were all it\\namounted to.11The determining ground of the will is the principle or reason\\non which one acts. As Kant ’s explanation indicates, a material practical\\nprinciple is thus one in which the ground of choice is given by an object for\\nwhich one has an independently given desire. Simply put, it is a principle\\nwhich there is reason to accept on the condition that one has an independent\\ndesire for (or is antecedently disposed to take satisfaction in) an object. A\\ndesire is independent in this context if it is not produced by one ’s accepting\\nthe principle, and if the object of the desire can be described without reference\\nthat we have a tendency to make value claims on behalf of empirical interests, and that when we do\\nso\\nwe act as though these interests are all that there are to the self. It is such claims that pure\\npractical reason must limit.\\n10Lest the case be overstated, it is important to bear in mind that Kant regards the satisfaction of\\ndesire-based interests as good when certain conditions are ful ﬁlled. For example, note that self-\\nlove is called “rational self-love ”when limited to conditions of moral permissibility [ 73]. For\\ndiscussion of Kant ’s notion of conditional goodness, see Christine Korsgaard, Creating the\\nKingdom of Ends , chs. 4,8–9.\\n11See34:“Now it is indeed undeniable that every volition must have an object and hence a\\nmatter; but the matter is not, just because of this, the determining ground and condition of the\\nmaxim ...”See also MM 6:381–85, where Kant claims that every action has an end, that there are\\nobjective ends that it is a duty to have, and that objective ends can be the “material ground of\\nchoice ”[MM 6:381].Introduction\\nxixto the principle.12Since the “object ”or“matter of the faculty of desire ”to\\nwhich Kant refers is presumably an end contained in the principle (either an\\nend prescribed by the principle, or the end to which an action is prescribed\\nas a means), the idea is that there is a reason to act on this principle only if one\\nhas an independent desire for this end.\\nTo illustrate, let’s take Kant’s example of the principle that one should\\nwork and save in one ’s youth so as not to want in one ’s old age [ 20]. Individuals\\nnormally desire comfort and security, and will have these desires in their\\nold age. Given the fact that one will have these desires when older and that\\nworking and saving when younger are necessary means to their satisfaction,\\nthere is reason to work and save for this purpose now. The desires for comfort\\nand security are independently given desires: they are not (or will not be)\\nproduced by your accepting this principle, and their objects of comfort and\\nsecurity can be speci ﬁed without referring to the principle. If you know that\\nyou will not have these desires –for example, because you know that you will\\nnot live that long, are willing to forgo comfort later in life in order to consume\\nmore now, and so on –then it would seem that you have no reason to work\\nand save now for that purpose. Since it is a condition of your having reason to\\nwork and save now that you will have these independent desires, the principle\\nis a material practical principle. In contrast, consider the principle that one\\nought to treat others fairly (where fair treatment is prescribed as an end).\\nSomeone who accepts this principle will be motivated to treat others fairly, but\\nthis desire is not independent of the principle. The desire to treat others fairly\\nis produced by accepting the principle, and the object of the desire (fair\\ntreatment of others) can only be speciﬁ ed by a principle; we can ’t say what\\nit is a desire for until we have a principle de ﬁning fair treatment. Because the\\ndesire to treat others fairly is a consequence of one’s accepting the principle,\\nthe presence of this desire is not –in fact, cannot be –a condition of having a\\nreason to accept the principle. Since the reason to accept the principle does\\nnot depend on an independently given desire, it is not a material practical\\nprinciple.\\nTo continue with the argument, one has reason to act on a material practical\\nprinciple only if one has an independent desire for, or will take satisfaction in,\\nits object. Thus one cannot determine whether an agent has reason to act on\\nsuch a principle without empirical information about that agent ’s desires and\\ncircumstances. But the validity of a law must be rooted in the basic features of\\nagency, and cannot depend on contingent conditions of this sort that distin-\\nguish one agent from another. Such principles therefore cannot provide laws.\\n12Here and in the next paragraph I draw on Rawls ’s distinction between “object-dependent\\ndesires ”and “principle-dependent desires. ”See John Rawls, Political Liberalism (New York:\\nColumbia University Press, 1996), pp. 82–86. Also relevant here is Thomas Nagel ’s distinction\\nbetween motivated and unmotivated desires; see Nagel, The Possibility of Altruism (Princeton:\\nPrinceton University Press, 1978), pp. 29–30.Introduction\\nxxTheorem II offers a further generalization about material principles,\\nclaiming that they are “of one and the same kind and come under the general\\nprinciple of self-love or one ’s own happiness ”[22]. This assertion is somewhat\\npuzzling, because other-regarding natural desires such as compassion, or\\naffection for loved ones, could be the basis of principles that are desire-based\\nin Kant ’s sense, but nonetheless directed at the well-being of others. In what\\nsense do all material principles fall under the principle of happiness? What\\nKant does here is to make explicit a structural feature shared by material\\nprinciples. In acting on such a principle, one takes the fact that the object offers\\nprospective satisfaction as a reason for acting, and one decides how to act by\\nasking how much satisfaction it offers –which, of course, is a function of one ’s\\ncurrent desires and dispositions. Kant de ﬁnes the principle of happiness or\\nself-love as the principle of making one ’s overall happiness “the supreme\\ndetermining ground of choice ”[22]. In other words, it is the principle of\\nacting so as to maximize satisfaction over the course of one ’s life. If this is\\nyour fundamental principle of action, you take the contribution of an action to\\nyour overall satisfaction as a measure of the reasons in its favor, and decide how\\nto act by asking what will bring you most overall satisfaction. The principle of\\nhappiness thus expresses a formal feature which all material principles share,\\nwhich highlights the way in which such principles provide reasons and the\\nmethod of choice employed in acting on them.13In the Corollary and ﬁrst\\nRemark to Theorem II, Kant argues that if all practical principles were material,\\none could draw no interesting distinction between a “higher faculty of desire ”\\nand a “lower faculty of desire. ”This is a distinction between different ways\\nin which the will is determined, or between different models of motivation\\nand choice. Kant ’s point is that if all practical principles were material princi-\\nples, there would be no reason to introduce any model of choice other than\\nthat captured by the principle of happiness. In fact, it would not be anyone ’s\\nprinciple, but just a description of human volition –as most empiricists believe.\\nKant now argues in Theorem III that it is the form of a principle that\\ndetermines whether it can serve as a practical law, and then considers what\\nthat form is. Theorems I and II have shown that principles that are reason-\\ngiving through their matter (i.e., which there is reason to adopt only if one\\nhas an independent desire for the object) fall under the principle of happiness\\nand provide no laws. If we abstract away the matter of a principle as a potential\\nsource of reasons, all that remains is its form. Thus if we are to regard a\\nprinciple or maxim as a practical law, it must determine the will through its\\nform alone –that is, it must be one that there is suf ﬁcient reason to accept\\n13For more on this point, see Andrews Reath, “Hedonism, Heteronomy and Kant ’s Principle of\\nHappiness, ”reprinted in Agency and Autonomy in Kant ’s Moral Theory . Remarks in these pages of\\ntheCritique have led many people to read Kant as a psychological hedonist about non-moral\\nmotives. I argue against that interpretation in this paper. For further discussion of this issue, see\\nBarbara Herman, Moral Literacy (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2007), ch. 8.Introduction\\nxx\\nisimply in virtue of its form. Such principles have the “form of law ”–the form\\nthat enables a principle to serve as a practical law.\\nThe simplicity of Kant ’s argument masks a number of perplexities and\\nwe shall not attempt a complete treatment here. A few things seem relatively\\nclear. First, some practical principles have the form of law while others do\\nnot.14Whether a principle has the form of law is ascertained by the Categorical\\nImperative, which yields a formal procedure that assesses a maxim of action by\\nasking whether it can be willed as universal law without inconsistency.15Kant\\ngives an example in which one accepts a monetary deposit from someone\\nwho subsequently dies. Since no record was made, no one can prove that one\\nhas the deposit, and one has only to deny its existence to keep the money.\\nBut a maxim of violating the trust of others in order to increase one ’s wealth\\ndoes not have the form of law, as we see from the impossibility of willing it\\nas universal law: it would be self-defeating if made a principle from which\\nanyone may act. Second, whether a principle has the form of law can determine\\nwhether there is suf ﬁcient reason to act on it. Again, there are a number of\\nissues that need sorting out, but we can say this much. The fact that a maxim\\ndoes nothave the form of law (as determined by the Categorical Imperative) is\\nas u fﬁcient reason to refrain from certain actions and a suf ﬁcient reason to\\nperform certain others. In Kant ’s example, since the maxim of violating trust to\\nincrease one ’s wealth cannot be universalized, it is impermissible to deny that\\nthe deposit was made (regardless of how much one would bene ﬁtf r o mt h e\\nmoney), and it is one ’s duty to reveal its existence. Alternatively, having the\\nform of law is a condition that must be satis ﬁed for there to be suf ﬁcient reason\\nto act on a principle. For example, an action that contributes to one ’so v e r a l l\\nhappiness is reasonably adopted and fully worthy of choice if –but only if –its\\nmaxim is universalizable.\\nThird, Theorem III has stated the condition that a principle must satisfy if\\nit is to serve as a practical law –that there must be suf ﬁcient reason to accept\\nit simply in virtue of its form. Clearly this condition is intended to lead (as it\\ndoes later in § 7) to a general principle that is an alternative to the principle\\nof happiness, namely the higher order principle of acting only from maxims\\nthat are reason-giving through their form, thus having the form of law. This\\nprinciple itself must be reason-giving through its form –because, we might\\nsay, it is a formal expression of the way in which practical laws provide reasons.\\nAnd it is a law –the moral law, in fact. Kant takes it to be an abstract statement\\n14Here note the ﬁrst sentence of the Remark to Theorem iii.\\n15For some discussions of the form of reasoning based on the universal law formula of the\\nCategorical Imperative, see Onora O ’Neill, Constructions of Reason (Cambridge University Press,\\n1989), chs. 5–8; Christine M. Korsgaard, Creating the Kingdom of Ends , chs. 3,5; Barbara Herman,\\nThe Practice of Moral Judgment (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1993), chs. 3,6–7,\\nand10; Rawls, Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy , Kant: Lecture II; and Allen Wood,\\nKant ’s Ethical Thought (Cambridge University Press, 1999), ch. 3.Introduction\\nxx\\niiof the basic principle used by “the most common understanding ”[27]t o\\ndetermine whether an action is morally permissible.\\nKant argues next that “freedom and unconditional practical law recipro-\\ncally imply each other ”[29]. His aim is to establish two claims that together\\nestablish a deep connection between morality and freedom. They are: ( 1)I f\\nan agent ’s basic principle is to act only from maxims with the form of law (the\\nmoral law), the agent is transcendentally free; and ( 2) If an agent has a free will,\\nthen the moral law is the basic principle of his will. The argument for the ﬁrst\\nis given as the solution to “Problem I ”: Assume an agent who ﬁnds sufﬁcient\\nreason to act on a maxim only if the maxim has the form of law. Such an agent\\nhas the ability to abstract from and, if necessary, set aside reasons taken from\\nhis desire-based interests. For example, the weight of the agent ’s desire-based\\ninterests in practical reasoning is not determined by the strength of various\\ndesires, but by a judgment issuing from a rational procedure that assesses\\nwhether a maxim of acting on some interest has the form of law. One ’s desire-\\nbased interests are ultimately traceable to the empirical conditions which\\nproduce these desires. Thus an agent who can act from reasons for action\\nbased on the legislative form of a maxim, in abstraction from desire-based\\ninterests, can act independently of empirical conditions. An agent with the\\nability to act on this kind of reason satis ﬁes the deﬁnition of transcendental\\nfreedom. The other argument solves “Problem II ”: An agent with a free will\\ncan determine himself to act independently of empirical conditions. Since an\\nagent with a will is guided by his conception of what he has reason to do, that\\nis to say: he can act from reasons that are independent of his desire-based\\ninterests, or (in Kant’s terms) independent of the “matter ”of a principle. But\\na will must act on some principle; otherwise it would display random activity\\nthat would not count as volition. What, then, can serve as its basic principle,\\nby which it determines how to act? Since its basic reasons for action do not\\ndepend on the matter of a principle, they must be taken from the form. That is\\nto say that a free will must have the basic principle of taking the legislative\\nform of a maxim as a suf ﬁcient reason for action.16\\nBy this point Kant has, beginning from a de ﬁnition of a practical law (§ 1),\\nestablished the basic condition that a practical law must satisfy (Theorem III)\\nand an analytical connection between freedom and practical law (§§ 5–6). In §7 ,\\nKant states the “Fundamental Law of Pure Practical Reason, ”which he\\nidentiﬁes as the Categorical Imperative. In stating it as an imperative, Kant\\npresents it as a valid law, and he claims here that the moral law is established\\nas a “fact of reason ”[ein Faktum der Vernunft ].17In ordinary practical\\n16Kant develops a more satisfactory version of this argument in the opening sections of\\nGroundwork ,iii[446–47]. For discussion, see the references to Hill and Korsgaard in note 2,\\nand Allison, Kant ’s Theory of Freedom , ch. 11.\\n17On the fact of reason, see Rawls, Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy , Kant: Lecture VII,\\nespecially p. 260:Introduction\\nxx\\niiireasoning we do take the moral law as a source of authoritative requirements\\nthat limit the weight that we may give to our desire-based interests, and we are\\nable to act on these requirements simply because we ought to. The authority\\nof the moral law is reﬂ ected in the standards to which we hold ourselves, the\\nphenomenon of respect for the moral law, the workings of conscience and the\\nmoral emotions, and so on. Because of the necessity with which moral require-\\nments present themselves, we presume that they are requirements of reason.\\nKant ’s analysis con ﬁrms their basis in reason by identifying the features that\\nwould be true of a law prescribed by reason and showing that they are present\\nin the basic principle of ordinary moral thought. But the authority of the moral\\nlaw rests ultimately on the fact that it is ﬁrmly rooted in ordinary thought and\\nexperience [cf. 91–92].\\nThe fact of reason shows that there are practical laws. It follows that reason\\nby itself provides suf ﬁcient determining grounds of the will. Given that laws\\ndetermine the will through their form (Theorem III), that a will for whom the\\nform of law provides a suf ﬁcient reason for action is transcendentally free\\n(Problem I), and that the fundamental principle of morality is a law for us and\\na determining ground of our will as shown by the fact of reason, it follows that\\nwe are transcendentally free.\\nWhile Kant sometimes identi ﬁes the fact of reason, or consciousness of the\\nauthority of the moral law, with consciousness of freedom,18he is clear that it\\nis our recognition of the authority of the moral law that reveals our freedom,\\nand that in the absence of such moral consciousness we would have no\\nreason to ascribe freedom to ourselves [ 30–1,47–8]. The sort of causality\\nwhich a will exercises is a function of the character of the principles by which\\nit is governed. The moral law provides its own suf ﬁcient grounds of choice\\nbased on the legislative form of one ’s maxims, which require us to abstract\\nfrom subjective interests in determining what we have reason to do. A will\\ngoverned by such a principle thus has the ability to act independently of\\ndetermination by empirical conditions. The validity of the moral law and\\nthe reality of transcendental freedom are, in effect, different aspects of pure\\nThe fact of reason is the fact that, as reasonable beings, we are conscious of the moral law as the\\nsupremely\\nauthoritative and regulative law for us and in our ordinary moral thought and\\njudgment we recognize it as such.\\nSee also Lewis White Beck, A Commentary on Kant ’sCritique of Practical Reason (Chicago:\\nUniversity of Chicago Press, 1960), pp. 166–75, and “The Fact of Reason: An Essay on\\nJustiﬁ cation in Ethics, ”inStudies in the Philosophy of Kant (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1965),\\npp.200–14; and Allison, Kant ’s Theory of Freedom , ch. 13. More secondary literature is cited\\nbelow in Further reading.\\nThe “fact of reason ”is an unusual notion, as may be acknowledged in Kant ’sr e m a r kt h a to u r\\nconsciousness of the moral law is the “sole fact of pure reason ”[31]. As Kant stresses, it is\\ncertainly not an empirical fact supported by sensible intuition. His choice of this expression\\nsignals that the authority of the moral law is given with a kind of immediacy: we are directly\\naware in an underived way of the authority of the moral law and the law-giving activity of pure\\npractical reason.\\n18As at 42:“this fact is inseparably connected with, and indeed identical with, consciousness of\\nfreedom of the will. ”Cf. also 29–30,46.Introduction\\nxxivpractical reason: the moral law is the basic principle, and transcendental\\nfreedom is the kind of causality exercised by agents whom it can motivate.\\nBut the grounds for attributing such causality to ourselves come from the\\ncharacteristics of this principle.19\\nOne of the most intriguing aspects of Kant’s demonstration of freedom\\nis that, as he insists, it does not extend theoretical knowledge, but gives the\\nconcept “objective, and though only practical, undoubted reality ”and that it is\\nintroduced “for none other than a practical purpose ”[49]. What Kant must\\nsubstantiate is that the assertion of freedom is rationally based, but not in the\\nway that knowledge claims are. If so, it is not a claim to theoretical knowledge,\\nand therefore complies with the strictures of the ﬁrstCritique . His account\\nincludes these elements: That we are transcendentally free is, it would appear,\\na metaphysical claim about the self of just the sort that reason in its theoretical\\nuse attempted, but could not establish. And it is an assertion for which he\\nclaims rational and objective grounds: the reality of freedom “is proved by an\\napodictic law of practical reason ...”; the moral law reveals “that freedom is\\nreal”[3–4]. But it is the practical use of reason that, in the ways we have\\nseen, both supplies the grounds for this assertion and gives substance to, or\\nspeciﬁes, the abstract idea of freedom.20Practical reason supplies a determi-\\nnate statement of the law that governs the activity of a free will, and our\\nrecognition of the validity of the law is the ground for ascribing freedom to\\nourselves. Freedom is manifested in activities in which we acknowledge\\nthe authority of this law, such as patterns of reasoning and choice, responses\\nsuch as respect, and so on. Somewhat oversimplifying, our self-awareness of\\nsuch activities and capacities is an awareness of freedom. The way in which\\nvarious elements of moral consciousness give content to the notion of freedom\\nis analogous to the role of intuition in empirical knowledge. But since moral\\nconsciousness is not spatio-temporal intuition, the assertion of freedom does\\nnot have a theoretical basis. Moreover, this basis is unavailable. Transcendental\\n19The freedom revealed by our ability to act from the moral law is a perfectly general capacity to\\nact independently of determination by empirical conditions. It is important for Kant ’s theory that\\nthis capacity underlies allchoice and action, including those in which one acts from desire-based\\ninterests or non-moral motives. In other words, we are free in allexercises of agency, not just those\\nin which we act from moral reasons; otherwise (assuming that freedom is a condition of respon-\\nsibility) we would be responsible for our actions only when we act morally, and could not be held\\naccountable when we act contrary to morality. (Immoral and evil actions are freely chosen –that is\\nwhy they are evil.) Transcendental freedom is a feature of our will that we would have no reason to\\nascribe to ourselves in the absence of our moral capacities, and which may be most directly\\nmanifested when we act from moral motives. But what our moral consciousness reveals is a feature\\nof volition that it is present in all choice.\\n20See56:\\nthe concept [of unconditioned causality] is given signi ﬁcance in the moral law ...thus I have,\\nindeed, no intuition that would determine its objective theoretical reality for it, but it has\\nnonetheless a real application which is exhibited in concreto in dispositions or maxims, that is, it\\nhas practical reality which can be speci ﬁed; and this is suf ﬁcient to justify it even with regard to\\nnoumena.Introduction\\nxxvfreedom is not a possible object of intuition, nor is it needed to explain events.\\nThe fact that the concept of freedom cannot be determined in the way\\nnecessary to enter into empirical knowledge guarantees that it can only be\\nused for practical purposes, as part of our self-conception as agents.\\nThe last “theorem ”in Chapter I is Theorem IV. It introduces the central\\nnotion of autonomy, claiming among other things (i) that the moral law is a\\nprinciple of autonomy, in that a will subject to the moral law is bound only to\\nits own fundamental principle, or the principle through which reason is law-\\ngiving, and not to any external source of authority; and ( 2) that only such a\\nprinciple can ground necessary moral requirements. We cannot do justice to\\nthis complex notion here, but brieﬂ y: the moral law demands that one base\\none’s reasons on the legislative form of one ’s maxims, in abstraction from their\\nmatter. Kant believes that he has shown that in acting from this principle,\\none is guided by the will ’s own principle and is subject only to the authority\\ninherent in one ’s reason and to nothing external to reason. When one takes\\none’s reasons from the legislative form of one ’s maxims, one is motivated by\\nthat feature of a principle that makes it a law. One thus acts from the principle\\nthat is constitutive of practical reason, through which reason is law-giving.\\nBut when one bases one ’s reasons on the matter of a principle, one takes one ’s\\nreasons from a source external to reason.21Perhaps this allows us to see how\\nthe requirement expressed by the moral law is simply that of acting from the\\nprinciple that expresses the nature of pure practical reason, without submit-\\nting to any external authority. This is autonomy.\\nWe close this section with two comments about the signiﬁ cance of Kant’s\\ndoctrine of the fact of reason. First, by claiming that the moral law is given as a\\nfact of reason, Kant adopts a coherentist or non-foundationalist approach to\\nthe justiﬁ cation of morality, holding that the authority of morality cannot be\\nderived from theoretical reason, or from a conception of rationality or agency\\ndevoid of moral content –indeed, that it cannot be based on anything outside\\nof itself.22The shape that Kant ’s theory eventually takes explains in retrospect\\nsome of the barriers to producing this kind of “deduction ”of the moral law.\\n21For example, when one acts on a desire-based interest, one allows one ’s reasons for action to be\\ndetermined by one ’s desires, and ultimately by whatever external factors are responsible for one ’s\\ndesires. However, action that is desire-based in the ordinary sense is not the only form of\\nheteronomy. A principle of submitting to an uncritically accepted social, political, or religious\\nauthority –for example, of performing an action simply because it is demanded by someone in a\\nposition of authority –is a principle of heteronomy, and in precisely the same way: one allows one ’s\\nactions to be directed by a source of authority external to reason. Kant argues that moral theories\\nthat base the principle of right conduct on an antecedent conception of the good are principles of\\nheteronomy because they direct agents to take their reasons for action from a source external to\\nreason, in which one can fail to take an interest without irrationality [cf. 63–65]. Indeed, Kant uses\\nthe term “heteronomy ”mainly to refer to this kind of moral theory, which he thinks incapable of\\ngrounding obligation.\\n22For discussion of this point, see Rawls, Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy , pp. 266–68.\\nFor a discussion of Kant ’s non-foundationalism in a broader context, see Onora O’ Neill,\\nConstructions of Reason , chs. 1–3.Introduction\\nxxviThe moral law is a principle of reason, but of a form of reason that in the\\npractical sphere is revealed primarily through moral consciousness. If so, it is\\nunclear how to give a characterization of this form of practical reason that is\\nindependent of morality, which could then be cited as its basis. For the most\\nnatural characterization is simply to specify the basic principles of morality.\\nWhat alternative approaches to justi ﬁcation are there? One can articulate the\\nbasic principles that underlie ordinary moral judgments, and show how they\\nexpress values, attitudes towards persons, and conceptions of agency that are\\nﬁrmly rooted in ordinary thought and experience. One can show that the basic\\nprinciples of morality have the marks of a principle of reason. And one can\\nlook for ways in which the different uses of reason form a single coherent\\nsystem. Kant pursues all these avenues in the Critique .\\nSecond, the way in which the fact of reason warrants regarding ourselves\\nas free illustrates a way in which important aspects of our self-conception are\\nrooted in moral consciousness. Kant thinks the moral law provides insight\\ninto important deliberative and motivational capacities, including a form of\\npractical reason, that, apart from moral consciousness, we would not under-\\nstand, much less have any reason to attribute to ourselves. To give an account\\nof these capacities we need to engage in moral theory, because a full descrip-\\ntion of the relevant capacities presupposes an account of the content and\\nstructure of the principles which guide practical reasoning and choice. If so,\\nit is a mistake to allow conceptions of practical reason and motivation that are\\ndeveloped independently of morality to set prior constraints on the content of\\nmoral theory –for instance, by insisting that acceptable moral principles must\\nﬁt into a conception of motivation or rationality derived solely from empirical\\ninquiry. Moral theory must be free to articulate the principles that we actually\\nrecognize, and to secure those insights into our nature which they provide.\\nIV\\nChapters II and III of the Analytic take up, respectively, the concept of\\nthe\\ngood as the “object of practical reason ”–as that which one wills under\\nthe direction of rational principles and is thus “an object of the faculty of\\ndesire in the judgment of every reasonable human being ”[61]–and respect\\nfor morality as the moral incentive and the feeling that is the motivational\\nconsequence of recognizing the authority of morality. What explains this\\nsequence of chapters? Kant tells us that since theoretical knowledge is con-\\ncerned with cognition of objects that are given in sensible intuition, the\\nAnalytic of the Critique of Pure Reason must begin with an account of the a\\npriori forms of sensibility and proceed from there to the a priori concepts\\nof objects of possible experience (the pure categories) and subsequently to the\\na priori principles of the understanding. But since practical reason is con-\\ncerned with determining grounds of the will –with the capacity to realize the\\nobjects represented as good –its critique proceeds in the reverse order, fromIntroduction\\nxxviithe basic principle or law of pure practical reason, to the good as object of\\npractical reason, and ﬁnally to the motivational effect of the moral law, i.e., its\\neffect on feeling or sensibility [ 89–90]. This explanation of the order of topics\\nis not merely “architectonic. ”The necessity and deliberative priority that\\ncommon sense assigns to morality is genuine only if morality is based on a law\\nthat makes necessary demands on the will. This law is conceptually prior to\\nand determines (or sets limits on) any conception of the good. Likewise the\\nfeeling of respect that Kant identi ﬁes as the proper moral motive must be a\\nresponse to the authority of moral principle and not an independent feature of\\nour psychology that is the basis of its authority.\\nA central aim of Chapter II is to argue for a thesis about “the method of\\nultimate moral investigation ”[64] and to explain what Kant calls the “paradox\\nof method ”encountered in the Critique –“that the concept of good and evil\\nmust not be determined before the moral law ...but only ...after and by\\nmeans of it” [63]. Kant contrasts the traditional method of moral philosophy,\\nwhich begins with a conception of what is good, with his own method of\\nﬁrst establishing the fundamental law, and argues that his method alone can\\nestablish the unconditional authority of moral principle. Theories with the\\nﬁrst structure begin by presenting some end as intrinsically or self-evidently\\ngood. Examples of the good that Kant has in mind from the tradition include\\nhappiness, perfection, conformity with moral feeling, or conformity with\\ndivine law [ 40–41]. From some such object the theory derives a set of practical\\nprinciples (say, to act in ways that promote or are in conformity with this\\nobject), and the normative force of the resulting principles stems from our\\npresumed interest in this end. Kant terms such theories “material principles\\nof morality ”[39] because they assign a foundational role to an object, end, or\\nvalue that is given to the will in which we are presumed to have an interest,\\nor whose authority is taken for granted. Kant has several reasons for thinking\\nthat such theories fail to show that moral principles are genuine “practical\\nlaws ”or categorical imperatives.23But his basic point is that theories that\\nfollow the traditional method of beginning from a conception of the good in\\nwhich interest is assumed do not show that it is rationally necessary to take an\\ninterest in that end or value. Moreover, since such theories do not undertake\\nany critical examination of the nature of practical reason or the necessary\\ncommitments of rational agents, they lack the resources to establish any such\\n23In Chapter ii, Kant argues that if a moral theory assigns a foundational role to the good –if it\\nsimply assumes a conception of what is good –the only criterion for assessing that proposed\\nconception is whether or not it elicits interest on our part. Since no a priori standard of good has\\nbeen argued for or established, the criterion for assessing the proposed conception is “nothing\\nother than the agreement of the object with our feeling of pleasure or displeasure ”[63]. Kant\\nthinks that it follows from such theories that nothing is “immediately good, ”since what is good\\nstrictly speaking is determined through rational judgments and universally communicable criteria\\n[58,63]. All goodness is then instrumental, “only good for something ”–it is what is good as a\\nmeans to the object or value initially presented to the will [ 59].Introduction\\nxxvii\\ninecessary claim. Hence they cannot establish genuine laws. This is the force of\\nKant ’s objection to “material principles of morality ”that they are principles of\\nheteronomy. Since they base the authority of morality in an end or value given\\nto the will from the outside, which are not rationally necessary, they can at best\\nshow only that moral requirements are hypothetical imperatives.24\\nIn Kant ’s alternative method, which we see employed in Chapter I, the\\nfundamental task of moral theory is to establish a law or principle that makes a\\nnecessary claim on the will. But a principle carries this kind of authority only\\nif it is a “formal law ”that expresses the necessary commitments of rational\\nagents, or as we might say, if it is in some sense the will ’s own law. The only\\ntruly necessary objects of volition are those that are internal to the will, or\\nthat follow from the application of its own law. But a formal law that expresses\\nthe necessary commitments of rational agency is a law that the will or practical\\nreason gives to itself and in that sense is a principle of autonomy. Thus, genuine\\ncategorical imperatives are possible only if morality is based on autonomy. As\\nKant says, “only a formal law, that is, one that prescribes to reason nothing\\nmore than the form of its universal lawgiving as the supreme condition of\\nmaxims, can be a priori a determining ground of the will ”[64;c f .41].25\\nChapter III, “On the Incentives of Pure Practical Reason, ”is a detailed\\ndiscussion of respect for morality as both the proper moral motive and as\\nmoral feeling. Agents who act out of respect for the moral law are motivated to\\nact by their recognizing moral considerations as suf ﬁcient reasons for action\\nthat take priority over and limit the force of the reasons provided by one ’s\\ninterest in happiness.

Heteronomy is a feature of practical\\nprinciples based on ends that are given to the will from the outside, that are not internal to rational\\nvolition. Autonomy is not compromised when an end is given by the moral law or is a necessary\\nfeature of rational agency, and rationally necessary ends ﬁgure prominently in Kant ’s moral\\nconception. Rational nature or humanity as an end in itself, which Kant in the Groundwork calls\\nthe“matter ”of morality [ G4:436], is an end or value to which rational agents are necessarily\\ncommitted, and the moral law generates obligatory ends, e.g., the happiness of others and one ’s\\nown perfection. De ﬁning the good as the object of practical reason, among other things, allows\\nKant in the Dialectic to introduce the highest good as the ﬁnal end of moral conduct. Since the\\nhighest good is an end de ﬁned by the moral law, its introduction is consistent with Kant ’s views\\nabout autonomy and the priority of the moral law over the concept of the good.\\n25Also worth noting in this survey is the section appended to the Chapter ii,“Of the Typic of\\nPure Practical Judgment. ”Though brief and obscure, it is important to Kant ’s account of the\\nCategorical Imperative. Kant explains that we judge whether an action is an instance of a\\nuniversally valid rule of pure practical reason, or what is the same thing, an instance of the\\nmoral good, by attempting to conceive of its maxim as a universal law of nature. Our concern in\\nmoral evaluation, of course, is whether an action instantiates a valid “law of freedom. ”Here Kant\\nclaims that a law of nature serves as the “type ”for a law of freedom, by which he means that a\\nhypothetical law of nature supplies a concrete exempli ﬁcation of the property of lawfulness,\\nthrough which we can judge whether an action is a case of a universally valid rule, or has the\\nform of law. This discussion bears on the related formulations of the Categorical Imperative given\\ninG4:421, the second of which reads: “Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through\\nyour will a universal law of nature. ”Introduction\\nxxixauthority of morality. But it may also be viewed as the feeling produced by our\\nrecognition of the authority of morality; or as we might put it, it is how rational\\nagents who are moved by certain kinds of sensible dispositions experience\\nthe motivational ef ﬁcacy of the moral law. Much of this chapter thus explores\\nhow moral consciousness affects the human faculty of desire and feeling when\\nit regulates our tendency to regard the claims of self-love as suf ﬁcient reasons\\nfor action.26\\nV\\nThe Dialectic completes the project of conferring practical reality on the\\nproble\\nmatic concepts of speculative reason by arguing for the existence of\\nGod and the immortality of the soul as “practical postulates ”which provide\\nthe elements of a “pure practical rational faith” [146]. Kant occasionally\\nrefers to freedom as a postulate in the Dialectic, but his considered view\\nstresses an important difference: the (practical) reality of freedom is estab-\\nlished directly by the authority of the moral law, while the postulates of\\nGod and immortality are introduced as necessary conditions of the practical\\npossibility of the highest good.\\nThe argument for the postulates runs as follows. Kant argues that the\\nmoral law generates a duty to do all we can to bring about the highest good in\\nthe world, which he speci ﬁes as a state of affairs in which all agents have\\nachieved virtue and happiness is distributed in accordance with virtue.27As\\nfar as we can see, the possibility of the highest good is consistent with the\\nlaws of nature, in that it would result if everyone acted from the moral law.\\nPossibility in the minimal sense of consistency with natural laws is a condition\\nof there being a duty to promote the highest good. However, since our experi-\\nence of human events offers no evidence that such a state of affairs is actually\\nachievable, and if anything, indicates the contrary, it seems at best an empty\\npossibility. But we cannot rationally and in good faith adopt a state of affairs as\\nour end if we do not believe it to be a real possibility, nor, more to the point,\\nwithout a conception of the world that shows us how it might occur. Thus is\\ngenerated a contradiction within practical reason, which Kant refers to as its\\n“antinomy ”[113]. For morality creates a duty to promote a state of affairs\\nwhich our experience suggests is mere fantasy –an“empty imaginary end ”\\n26For discussions of Chapter iii, see Andrews Reath, “Kant ’s Theory of Moral Sensibility, ”\\nreprinted in Agency and Autonomy , and Stephen Engstrom, “The Triebfeder of Pure Practical\\nReason, ”in Andrews Reath and Jens Timmermann, Kant ’sCritique of Practical Reason :A\\nCritical Guide (Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010).\\n27The joint satisfaction of these two conditions would imply that all individuals are virtuous\\nand are able to achieve their permissible ends. How the highest good is introduced or constructed\\nby the moral law, what its content is, and what the basis is (if any) of the duty to pursue the highest\\ngood are controversial questions. For discussion, see the secondary literature on the Dialectic\\nrecommended below in Further Reading.Introduction\\nxxx[114]–and which, therefore, it seems that we cannot adopt as our end\\nwithout some kind of irrationality. The only way in which we can conceive of\\nthe highest good as a real possibility is by assuming the immortality of the\\nsoul and the existence of God as a moral author of the universe who has\\nordered the laws of nature to support the possibility of moral ends. Thus a\\n“need of pure practical reason ”licenses us to postulate the existence of God\\nand the immortality of the soul.\\nThe “antinomy of practical reason ”and the idea of a “need of practical\\nreason ”deserve further comment. This antinomy results when practical\\nreason imposes contradictory demands that threaten its internal coherence:\\nwhen pure practical reason generates a duty to promote an end which it is\\neither irrational to adopt, or “practically impossible to strive for ”[143], given\\nour inability to conceive of its possibility in concrete terms. It is important\\nto Kant ’s argument that the antinomy affect neither the validity of the moral\\nlaw, nor the duty to promote the highest good. If the latter especially did not\\nremain in force as an unconditional requirement, we could resolve the antin-\\nomy by abandoning this duty.\\nThe argument for the postulates turns on the fact that we need to conceive\\nof the possibility of the highest good as a condition of making it our end, and\\nthe structure of this need is quite complex. Kant does not simply claim that\\nwe are warranted in postulating the existence of God: rather “it is morally\\nnecessary to assume the existence of God ”[125], though he quali ﬁes this\\nnecessity as “subjective ”rather than “objective, ”insisting that it is a need,\\nnot a duty or a command [ 125–26,144–46]. Generally speaking, a need is a\\ncondition of satisfying an interest that one in some sense is not free to abandon.\\nSince the duty to promote the highest good is objectively necessary, we may\\nnot abandon our interest in it. A condition of making the highest good our end\\nis that we have a way of representing it to ourselves as possible, and this may\\nbe done in different ways. The fact that it is not inconsistent with the laws of\\nnature leads to a representation of its possibility, though not one that Kant\\nthinks can sustain our commitment to it. Given our limited perspective on\\nthe world and given the way in which our cognitive faculties operate, the only\\nway of representing the possibility of the highest good that enables us to\\nmake it our end is through the postulates.28This is a “subjective condition of\\n28Cf.145: the impossibility of the highest good:\\nismerely subjective , that is, our reason ﬁnds it impossible for it to conceive, in the mere course of\\nnature, a connection so exactly proportioned and so thoroughly purposive between events\\noccurring in the world in accordance with such different laws, although, as with everything else\\nin nature that is purposive, it nevertheless cannot prove ...the impossibility of it in accordance\\nwith universal laws of nature.\\nAssuming a “wise author presiding over nature ”is, due to a “subjective condition of reason, ”\\nthe only way in which it is theoretically possible for [reason] to think the exact harmony of\\nnature with the realm of morals as the condition of the possibility of the highest good, and at the\\nsame time the only way that is conducive to morality ...[145].Introduction\\nxxxiour reason ”which makes it necessary for us to represent the possibility of the\\nhighest good in this rather than some other way.29\\nThere are many points at which one might criticize Kant ’s argument, but it\\nmay be more instructive instead to consider the signi ﬁcance of the notion of\\na“practical postulate. ”Kant presents these postulates as rationally grounded\\nbeliefs about the world and about ourselves that are justi ﬁed on other than\\ntheoretical grounds –that is, that are grounded in practical interests that we are\\nnot free to abandon. The postulates are theoretical or speculative assertions –\\nassertions which “theoretical reason is justi ﬁed in assuming ”[134], or which\\n“speculative reason must concede ”[144;c f .120 –21,135] about the “physical\\nor metaphysical conditions, in a word those which lie in the nature of things,\\nof the possibility of the highest good ...”[143]. Their justi ﬁcation requires\\nspecial conditions. They must be conceptually coherent and may not contra-\\ndict any established theoretical claim –a condition secured by transcendental\\nidealism. Accepting these assertions must be a “need of pure practical reason ”\\nin the sense that it is a necessary condition of adopting an end which is morally\\nrequired. Finally, the postulates must not be regarded as extending theoretical\\nknowledge of objects, and, e.g., cited to explain any events in nature. As\\nrationally grounded speculative assertions, they “extend speculative cognition ”\\n[132,134–35] but only “for practical purposes” [133], and they cannot be used\\nfor“theoretical purposes” [134]. Since the ground for the postulates is the\\nneed of practical reason just described, we may assert only what is necessary to\\nrender the possibility of the highest good conceivable. Moreover, since the\\nobjects of these assertions are not given in intuition, we are precluded from\\nmaking synthetic assertions which would determine their nature in any speci ﬁc\\nway. Thus, somewhat oversimplifying, Kant thinks that we may assert that\\nGod exists as a moral author of the universe, or that the soul is a simple eternal\\nsubstance, but cannot ascribe any determinate properties to these objects. The\\nfact that we are limited in what we may say about these objects guarantees that\\nthe postulates are only usable for the purpose of a conception of the world that\\nsupports the rationality of adopting the highest good as our end.\\nThe Dialectic clearly has the positive task of justifying the postulates in\\ntheir restricted practical use. Does it also have a signiﬁ cant critical function?\\nParallels between the antinomies of the ﬁrst and second Critiques suggest a\\ncritical function with similarities to the Analytic’s task of prescribing limits\\n29So there are at least two components to the need of pure practical reason. We need a way to\\nrepresent the possibility of the highest good; and because of the “subjective condition of our\\nreason, ”we need to represent its possibility by postulating a moral author of the universe who has\\nordered the laws of nature so as to support moral ends. Since different representations of the\\npossibility of the highest good are consistent with (i.e., not contradicted by) theoretical reason, we\\nare free to choose the one that we need.\\nKant says more about the idea of a need of reason in “What does it mean to orient oneself in\\nthinking? ”trans. by Allen Wood in Religion and Rational Theology (Cambridge Edition of the\\nWorks of Immanuel Kant), ed. Allen Wood and George di Giovanni (Cambridge University\\nPress, 1996).Introduction\\nxxxiito empirical practical reason. The antinomies of pure reason are apparent\\ncontradictions threatening the coherence of theoretical reason, generated in\\npart by the assumption that the objects given in experience are things-in-\\nthemselves, and they are resolved through the distinction between appear-\\nances and things-in-themselves. The antinomy of practical reason arises when\\na view of the course of human events based on our experience of the world\\nleads us to regard the highest good as a practical impossibility. While this view\\nof events is the only one available, conscientious moral agents ﬁnd themselves\\nin the untenable situation of setting out ideal moral goals that it is our duty to\\npursue, but which seem to be no more than empty, unachievable ideals, and\\nare therefore not rationally adopted. The distinction between appearances\\nand things-in-themselves points to a way out, in this case by creating room for\\ndifferent estimates about what may be possible within the course of events. If\\nwe may assert that the laws of nature have a noumenal ground –for example,\\nthat they are the product of a moral author of the universe –we would have a\\nway of envisioning how natural laws could support the possibility of moral\\nends, and may interpret events in the world as displaying progress toward the\\nachievement of moral goals when this reading is not contradicted by other\\nevident facts. As we have seen, this resolution of the antinomy is made\\navailable when the need of practical reason stemming from the duty to pursue\\nthe highest good provides the positive warrant for this assertion. The critical\\ntask of the Dialectic is thus to show that the contradiction that threatens the\\ncoherence of practical reason is only apparent. This it does by blocking an\\ninference from an empirically based conception of events that undermines the\\npossibility of committing ourselves to certain moral ideals, through the claim\\nthat they are purely fantastic goals that we have no hope of achieving.\\nThe extent to which all the important conclusions of the Critique are in\\nsome form a consequence of the fact that pure reason is practical is seen in the\\nway in which the extension of speculative belief represented by the postulates\\nis driven by practical interests and rests on what Kant terms the “primacy of\\npure practical reason ”[119].30When we ﬁnd that reason in its practical use\\nneeds to assert certain propositions that were transcendent for theoretical\\nreason, the question arises as to which use of reason has primacy. If it is\\nreasonable to accept only those assertions that can be established on theoretical\\ngrounds, speculative reason has primacy. If practical reason has primacy, it is\\nreasonable to accept speculative propositions that are presupposed by neces-\\nsary practical interests when the conditions outlined above are satis ﬁed: these\\npropositions contradict no established theoretical claim, accepting them is a\\n30For discussions of this idea, see Sebastian Gardener, “The Primacy of Practical Reason, ”in\\nGraham Bird, ed., A Companion to Kant (Oxford/Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing, 2006), and\\nMarcus Willaschek, “The Primacy of Practical Reason and the Idea of a Practical Postulate, ”in\\nReath and Timmermann, eds., Kant ’sCritique of Practical Reason.Introduction\\nxxxii\\nineed of pure practical reason, and they are not treated as extensions of\\nknowledge but are used only for practical purposes.

On the contrary, there is now disclosed a very\\n5:6 satisfying con ﬁrm ation of the speculative Critique ’s consistent way of thinking –\\none which was hardly to be expected before –inasmuch as it insisted on letting\\nobjects of experience as such, includi ng even our own subject, hold only as\\nappearances but at the same time on putting thing s in themselves at their basis and\\nhence on not taking everyt hing supersensible as a ﬁction and its concept as empty\\nof content; now practical reason of itself , without any collusion with speculative\\nreason, furnishes reality to a supersensible object of the category of causality,\\nnamely to freedom (although, as a practical concep t, only for practical use), and\\nhence establishes by means of a fact what could there only be thought .B yt h i s ,t h e\\nstrange though incontestable assertion of the speculative Critique, that even\\nthe thinking subject is in inner intuition a mere appearance to itself,g e t si t s\\nfull con ﬁrmation in the Critique of Practical Reason , and that so thoroughly that\\none would have to arrive at it even if the former had never proved this\\nproposition at all.*\\nBy this I also understand why the most considerable objections to the\\nCritique that have so far come to my attention turn about just these two\\npoints: namely, on the one side the objective reality of the categories applied\\nto noumena, denied in theoretical cognition and af ﬁrmed in practical, and on\\nthe other side the paradoxical requirement to make oneself as subject of freedom\\na noumenon but at the same, with regard to nature, a phenomenon in one ’s\\nown empirical consciousness; for, as long as one had as yet formed no deter-\\nminate concepts of morality and freedom, one could not conjecture, on the one\\nside, what one was to put as a noumenon at the basis of the alleged appearance\\nand, on the other side, whether it was at all possible even to form a concept of\\n*The union of causality as freedom with causality as natural mechanism, the ﬁrst of which is\\nestablished by the moral law, the second by the law of nature, and indeed in one and the same\\nsubject, the human being, is impossible without representing him with regard to the ﬁrst as a being\\nin itself but with regard to the second as an appearance, the former in pure, the latter in empirical\\nconsciousness. Otherwise the contradiction of reason with itself is unavoidable.CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n5it, since all the concepts of the pure understanding in its theoretical use had\\nalready been assigned exclusively 5:7 to mere appearances. Only a detailed Crit ique\\nof Practical Reason can remove all this misinterpretation and put in a clear light\\nthe consistent way of thinking that constitutes its greatest merit.\\nSo much by way of justifying [the fact] that in this work the concepts and\\nprinciplesiof pure speculative reason, which have already undergone their\\nspecial critique, are now and again subjected to examination; although this\\nwould not elsewhere be appropriate to the systematic procedure for construct-\\ning a science (since matters that have been decided should only be referred to\\nand not raised again), it was here allowed and indeed necessary because reason\\nis considered in transition to a quite different use of those concepts from what\\nit made of them there. Such a transition makes it necessary to compare the old\\nuse with the new, in order to distinguish well the new path from the previous\\none and at the same time to draw attention to their connection. Accordingly,\\nconsiderations of this kind, including those that are once more directed to the\\nconcept of freedom, though in the practical use of pure reason, should not be\\nregarded as interpolations which might serve only to ﬁll up gaps in the critical\\nsystem of speculative reason (for this is complete for its purpose), or as like the\\nprops and buttresses that are usually added afterwards to a hastily constructed\\nbuilding, but as true members that make the connection of the system plain,\\nso that concepts which could there be represented only problematically can\\nnow be seen in their real presentation. This reminder is especially relevant to\\nthe concept of freedom, with regard to which one cannot help observing with\\nsurprise that so many boast of being quite well able to understandjit and to\\nexplain its possibility while they consider it only in its psychological context,\\nwhereas if they had earlier pondered it carefully in its transcendental context\\nthey would have cognized its indispensability as a problematic concept in the\\ncomplete use of speculative reason as well as its complete incomprehensibility ;k\\nand if they afterwards proceeded with it to practical use, they would have\\nhad to arrive by themselves at the very same determination of it with respect\\nto its principles that they are now so unwilling to agree to. The concept of\\nfreedom is the stumbling block for all empiricists , but also the key to the most\\nsublime practical principles for critical moralists, who thereby see 5:8 that they\\nmust\\nnecessarily proceed rationally . For this reason I beg the reader not to\\npass lightly over what is said about this concept at the conclusion of the\\nAnalytic.\\nI must leave it to connoisseurs of a work of this kind to estimate whether such\\na system of pure practical reason as is here developed from the Critique of it has\\niGrundsätze . Here again, as in the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals , Kant draws no\\nconsistent distinction between Grundsatz andPrinzip. Prinzip is always, and Grundsatz often,\\ntranslated as “principle. ”\\njeinzusehenkUnbegrei ﬂichkeitIMMANUEL KANT\\n6cost much or little trouble, especially so as not to miss the right point of view\\nfrom which the whole can be correctly traced out. It presupposes, indeed, the\\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals , but only insofar as this constitutes\\npreliminary acquaintance with the principle of duty and provides and justi ﬁes a\\ndeterminate formula of it;* otherwise, it stands on its own. That the complete\\nclassiﬁcationlof all practical sciences was not added, such as the Critique of\\nspeculative reason carried out, has a valid ground in the constitutionmof this\\npractical rational faculty itself. For, the special determination of duties as\\nhuman duties, with a view to classifying them, is possible only after the\\nsubject of this determination (the human being) is cognized as he is really\\nconstituted, though only to the extent necessary with reference to duty\\ngenerally; this, however, does not belong to a Critique of Practical Reason as\\nsuch, which has only to give a complete account of the principles of its\\npossibility, of its extent, and of its limits, without special reference to\\nhuman nature. Here, accordingly, the classi ﬁcation belongs to the system of\\nscience, not to the system of critique.\\nIn the second chapter of the Analytic I have, I hope, dealt adequately with\\nthe objection of a certain reviewer2of the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of\\nMorals , one who is devoted to truth and astute and therefore always worthy\\nof respect: that there the concept of the good was not established before 5:9 the\\nmoral\\nprinciple (as, in his opinion, was necessary).†I have also taken into\\n*A reviewer1who wanted to say something censuring this work hit the mark better than he\\nhimself may have intended when he said that no new principle of morality is set forth in it but only\\nanew formula . But who would even want to introduce a new principle of all morality and, as it were,\\nﬁrst invent it? Just as if, before him, the world had been ignorant of what duty is or in thorough-\\ngoing error about it. But whoever knows what a formula means to a mathematician, which\\ndetermines quite precisely what is to be done to solve a problem and does not let him miss it,\\nwill not take a formula that does this with respect to all duty in general as something that is\\ninsigni ﬁcant and can be dispensed with.lEinteilungmBeschaffenheit†The further objection could have been put to me, why have I not previously explicated\\nthe concept of the faculty of desire or of the feeling of pleasure , although this reproach would\\nbe unfair because this explication as given in psychology could reasonably be presupposed.\\nHowever, the de ﬁnition there could admittedly be so framed that the feeling of pleasure\\nwould ground the determination of the faculty of desire (as is in fact commonly done), and\\nthus the supreme principle of practical philosophy would necessarily turn out to be\\nempirical , although this has to be settled ﬁrst and in the present Critique is altogether\\nrefuted. I will, therefore, give this explication here in the way it must be given in order, as\\nis reasonable, to leave this contested point undecided at the beginning –Life is the faculty\\nof a being to act in accordance with laws of the faculty of desire. The faculty of desire is a\\nbeing ’sfaculty to be by means of its representations the cause of the reality of the objects of these\\nrepresentations. Pleasure isthe representation of the agreement of an object or of an action with\\nthe subjective conditions of life , i.e., with the faculty of the causality of a representation with\\nrespect to the reality of its object (or with respect to the determination of the powers of the\\nsubject to action in order to produce the object). For the purposes of this Critique Ih a v en o\\nfurther need of concepts borrowed from psychology; the Critique itself supplies the rest. It\\nis easily seen that the question whether pleasure must always be put at the basis of the\\nfaculty of desire or whether under certain conditions pleasure only follows upon itsCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n7consideration many other objections that have reached me from men who\\nshow that they have at heart the discovery of truth, and I shall continue to do\\nso (for, those who have only their old system before their eyes and who have\\nalready settled what is to be approved or disapproved 5:10 do not desire any\\ndiscussio\\nn that might stand in the way of their private purpose).\\nWhen it is a matter of determining a particular faculty of the human\\nsoul as to its sources, its contents, and its limits, then, from the nature of\\nhuman cognition, one can begin only with the parts, with an accurate and\\ncomplete presentation of them (complete as far as is possible in the present\\nsituation of such elements as we have already acquired). But there is a\\nsecond thing to be attended to, which is more philosophic and architec-\\ntonic: namely, to grasp correctly the idea of the whole and from this idea to\\nsee all those parts in their mutual relation by means of their derivation\\nfrom the concept of that whole in a pure rational faculty. This examination\\nand guarantee is possible only through the most intimate acquaintance\\nwith the system; and those who ﬁnd the ﬁrst inquiry too irksome and\\nhence do not think it worth their trouble to attain such an acquaintance\\ncannot reach the second stage, namely the overview, which is a synthetic\\nreturn to what had previously been given analytically; and it is no wonder\\nthat they ﬁnd inconsistencies everywhere, although the gaps they suppose\\nthey ﬁnd are not in the system itself but only in their own incoherent train\\nof thought.\\nI have no fear, with respect to this treatise, of the reproach that I want to\\nintroduce a new language , because here the kind of cognition itself approaches\\npopularity. This reproach with respect to the ﬁrstCritique could also not have\\noccurred to anyone who had thought it through and not merely turned over\\nthe pages. To invent new words where the language already has no lack of\\nexpressions for given concepts is a childish effort to distinguish oneself from\\nthe crowd, if not by new and true thoughts yet by new patches on an old\\ngarment. If, therefore, the readers of that work know of more popular\\nexpressions that are still just as suitable to the thought as the ones I used\\nseem to me, or if they think they can show the nullity of these thoughts\\nthemselves and so too of the expressions signifying them, they would by the\\nﬁrst very much oblige me, for I only desire to be understood; but with respect\\nto the second, they would deserve well of philosophy. However, as long as\\ndetermination, is left undecided by this exposition; for it is composed only o f marks\\nbelonging to the pure understanding, i.e., categories, which contain nothing empirical.\\nSuch a precaution –namely, not to anticipate one ’s judgments by de ﬁnitions ventured\\nbefore complete analysis of the concept, which is often achieved very late –is to be highly\\nrecommended throughout philosophy, and yet is often neglected. It may be observed\\nthroughout the course of the critical philosophy (of theoretical as well as practical reason)\\nthat many opportunities are presented to make up for defects in the old dogmatic procedure\\nof philosophy and to correct errors that are not noticed until one makes such a use of\\nconcepts of reason as is directed to the whole.IMMANUEL KANT\\n8these thoughts stand, I 5:11 very much doubt that expressions suitable for them\\nand\\nyet more common can be found.*\\nIn this way the a priori principles of two faculties of the mind, the 5:12 faculty\\nof\\ncognition and that of desire, would be found and determined as to the\\nconditions, extent, and boundaries of their use, and a ﬁrm basis would thereby\\nbe laid for a scientiﬁ c system of philosophy, both theoretical and practical.\\nNothing worse could happen to these labors than that someone should\\nmake the unexpected discovery that there is and can be no a priori cognition\\nat all.3But there is no danger of this. It would be tantamount to someone ’s\\nwanting to prove by reason that there is no reason. For, we say that we cognize\\nsomething by reason only when we are aware that we could have known it\\neven if it had not presented itself to us as it did in experience; hence rational\\ncognition and cognition a priori are one and the same. It is an outright\\ncontradiction to want to extract necessity from an empirical proposition ( ex\\npumice aquam )nand to give a judgment, along with necessity, true universality\\n(without which there is no rational inference and so not even inference from\\nanalogy, which is at least a presumed universality and objective necessity and\\ntherefore presupposes it). To substitute subjective necessity, that is, custom,\\n*Here I am less worried (about that unintelligibility) than about occasional misinterpretation\\nwith\\nrespect to some expressions that I have sought out with the greatest care in order that the\\nconcepts to which they point may not be missed. Thus, in the table of categories of practical reason\\nunder the heading Modality, the permitted and the forbidden (the practically objectively possible\\nand impossible), have almost the same sense in the common use of language as the immediately\\nfollowing categories, duty andcontrary to duty ; here, however, the ﬁrstmean that which harmo-\\nnizes or con ﬂicts with a merely possible practical precept (as, say, the solution of all problems of\\ngeometry and mechanics), the second , that which is similarly related to a law actually present in\\nreason as such; and this distinction in meaning is not altogether foreign even to the common use of\\nlanguage, although it is somewhat unusual. Thus, for example, it is forbidden to an orator, as such,\\nto forge new words or constructions; this is to some extent permitted to a poet; in neither case is\\nthere any thought of duty. For if anyone is willing to forfeit his reputation as an orator, no one can\\nprevent him. We have here to do only with the distinction of imperatives under problematic,\\nassertoric , and apodictic determining grounds. So too, in the note where I compared the moral ideas\\nof practical perfection in different philosophic schools, I distinguished the idea of wisdom from that\\nofholiness , although I explained them as identical in their ground and objectively. In that place,\\nhowever, I understood by wisdom only that wisdom to which the human being (the Stoic) lays\\nclaim, and thus took it subjectively , as an attribute ascribed to the human being. (Perhaps the\\nexpression virtue, which the Stoic also made much of, could better indicate what is characteristic of\\nhis school.) But the expression, a postulate of pure practical reason, could most of all occasion\\nmisinterpretation if confused with the meaning that postulates of pure mathematics have, which\\nbring with them apodictic certainty. The latter, however, postulate the possibility of an action , the\\nobject of which has been previously theoretically cognized a priori with complete certitude as\\npossible . But the former postulate the possibility of an object itself (God and the immortality of the\\nsoul) from apodictic practical laws, and therefore only on behalf of a practical reason, so that this\\ncertainty of the postulated possibility is not at all theoretical, hence also not apodictic, i.e., it is not a\\nnecessity cognized with respect to the object but is, instead, an assumption necessary with respect\\nto the subject ’s observance of its objective but practical laws, hence merely a necessary hypothesis.\\nI could ﬁnd no better expression for this subjective but nevertheless unconditional rational\\nnecessity.n“water from a pumice stone ”(Plautus, The Persians 1.1.42)CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n9for objective necessity, which is to be found only in a priori judgments, is to\\ndeny to reason the ability to judge an object, that is, to cognize it and what\\nbelongs to it; it is to deny, for example, that when something often or always\\nfollows upon a certain prior state one could infer it from that (for this would\\nmean objective necessity and the concept of an a priori connection) and to say\\nonly that we may expect similar cases (just as animals do), that is, to reject the\\nconcept of cause fundamentally as false and a mere delusion of thought. As for\\nwanting to remedy this lack of objective and hence universal validity by saying\\nthat one sees no ground for attributing to other rational beings a different way\\nof representing things:oif that yielded a valid inference then our ignorance\\nwould render us greater service in enlarging our cognition than all our\\nreﬂection. For, merely because of our not knowing rational beings other\\nthan human beings, we would have a right to assume them to be constituted\\njust as we cognize ourselves to be, that 5:13 is, we would really know them. I do not\\neven\\nmention here that universality of assent does not prove the objective\\nvalidity of a judgment (i.e., its validity as cognition) but only that, even if\\nuniversal assent should happen to be correct, it could still not yield a proof of\\nagreement with the object; on the contrary, only objective validity constitutes\\nthe ground of a necessary universal agreement.\\nHume would be quite content with this system of universal empiricism\\nof principles; for, as is well known, he asked nothing more than that a merely\\nsubjective meaning of necessity, namely custom, be assumed in place of any\\nobjective meaning of necessity in the concept of cause, so as to deny to reason\\nany judgment about God, freedom, and immortality: and, if once his princi-\\nples were granted, he certainly knew very well how to draw conclusions from\\nthem with all logical validity. But Hume himself did not make empiricism so\\nuniversal as to include mathematics.4He held its propositions to be analytic,\\nand if this were correct they would in fact be apodictic also: but from this\\nno inference could be drawn to reason ’s ability to make apodictic judgments in\\nphilosophy as well, namely judgments that would be synthetic (as the prop-\\nosition of causality is). However, if one assumes a universal empiricism of\\nprinciples, then mathematics will be included.\\nNow, if mathematics comes into con ﬂict with a reason that admits only\\nempirical principles, as inevitably happens in the antinomy where mathematics\\nproves incontestably the in ﬁnite divisibility of space, which empiricism cannot\\nallow, then the greatest possible evidence of demonstration is in manifest\\ncontradiction with the alleged inferences from empirical principles, and one\\nhas to ask, like Cheselden ’s blind man, “Which deceives me, sight or touch? ”5\\n(For empiricism is based on a necessity felt, but rationalism on a necessity seen.)p\\nAnd thus universal empiricism reveals itself as genuine skepticism, which\\noVorstellungsartpeingesehenenIMMANUEL KANT\\n10in this unlimited sense has been falsely ascribed to Hume,* since he left at least\\none certain touchstone of experience 5:14 in mathematics, whereas genuine skep-\\nticism\\nadmits no such touchstone at all (which can only be found in a priori\\nprinciples), although experience consists not of feelings only but also of\\njudgments.\\nSince, however, in this philosophic and critical age such empiricism can\\nscarcely be taken seriously, and it is presumably put forward only as an\\nexercise for judgment and in order to put the necessity of rational a priori\\nprinciples in a clearer light by contrast, one can only be grateful to those who\\nare willing to trouble themselves with this otherwise uninstructive work.\\n*Names that designate the followers of a sect have always been accompanied with a good deal of\\ninjustice;6this would be much the case if someone said, N is an idealist . For, although he not only\\nadmits but even insists that real objects, external things, correspond to our representations of\\nexternal things, he nevertheless holds that the form of intuition of them does not depend on them\\nbut only on the human mind.CRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n115:15\\nIntroduction\\nOn the idea of a critique of practical reason\\nThe theoretical use of reason was concerned with objects of the cognitive\\nfaculty\\nonly, and a critique of it with regard to this use really dealt only with\\nthepurecognitive faculty, since this raised the suspicion, which was afterwards\\nconﬁrmed, that it might easily lose itself beyond its boundaries, among\\nunattainable objects or even among contradictory concepts. It is quite differ-\\nent with the practical use of reason. In this, reason is concerned with the\\ndetermining grounds of the will, which is a faculty either of producing objects\\ncorresponding to representations or of determining itself to effect such objects\\n(whether the physical power is suf ﬁcient or not), that is, of determining\\nits causality. For, in that, reason can at least suf ﬁce to determine the will\\nand always has objective reality insofar as volition alone is at issue. The ﬁrst\\nquestion here, then, is whether pure reason of itself alone suf ﬁces to determine\\nthe will or whether it can be a determining ground of the will only as\\nempirically conditioned. Now there enters here a concept of causality justi ﬁed\\nby the Critique of Pure Reason although not capable of being presented\\nempirically, namely that of freedom; and if we can now discover grounds for\\nproving that this property does in fact belong to the human will (and so to\\nthe will of all rational beings as well), then it will not only be shown that pure\\nreason can be practical but that it alone, and not reason empirically limited,\\nis unconditionally practical. Consequendy, we shall not have to do a critique\\nofpure practical reason but only of practical reason as such. For, pure reason,\\nonce 5:16 it is shown to exist, needs no critique. It is pure reason that itself contains\\nthe\\nstandard for the critical examination of every use of it. It is therefore\\nincumbent upon the Critique of Practical Reason as such to prevent empirically\\nconditioned reason from presuming that it, alone and exclusively, furnishes\\nthe determining ground of the will. If it is proved that there is pure reason, its\\nuse is alone immanent; the empirically conditioned use, which lays claim to\\nabsolute ruleqis on the contrary transcendent and expresses itself in demands\\nand commands that go quite beyond its sphere –precisely the opposite\\nrelation from what could be said of pure reason in its speculative use.\\nSince, however, it is still pure reason whose cognition here lies at the basis\\nof its practical use, the division of a Critique of Practical Reason must in its\\ngeneral outline be arranged in conformity with that of the speculative. We\\nqAlleinherrschaft\\n12shall therefore have to have a Doctrine ofElementsrand a Doctrine of Method for\\nit; and within the former, an Analytic , as the rule of truth, as the ﬁrst part, and\\naDialectic , as the exposition and resolution of illusionsin the judgments of\\npractical reason. However, the order in the subdivision of the Analytic will be\\nthe reverse of that in the Critique of pure speculative reason. For, in the\\npresent Critique we shall begin with principles and proceed to concepts , and only\\nthen, where possible, from them to the senses, whereas in the case of spec-\\nulative reason we had to begin with the senses and end with principles. The\\nground for doing so lies, again, in this: that now we have to do with a will and\\nhave to consider reason not in its relation to objects but in relation to this will\\nand its causality; thus the principles of empirically unconditioned causality\\nmust come ﬁrst, and only afterward can the attempt be made to establish our\\nconcepts of the determining ground of such a will, of their application to\\nobjects and ﬁnally to the subject and its sensibility. Here the law of causality\\nfrom freedom, that is, some pure practical rational principle, constitutes the\\nunavoidable beginning and determines the objects to which alone it can be\\nreferred.\\nrElementarlehre .O n “doctrine ”in its strict sense, see the text from the Critique of Judgment\\n(5:170) referred to in the note to The Metaphysics of Morals (6:205).sScheinCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n13Book I\\nThe analytic of pure practical reason\\nChapter I\\nOn\\nthe Principles of Pure Practical Reason\\n1.\\nDEFINITIONt\\nPractical principles are propositions that contain a general determination of\\nthe will, having under it several practical rules. They are subjective, or\\nmaxims , when the condition is regarded by the subject as holding only\\nfor his will; but they are objective, or practical laws, when the condition\\nis cognized as objective, that is, as h olding for the will of every rational\\nbeing.\\nRemark\\nIf it is assumed that pure reason can contain within itself a practical ground,\\nthat is, one suf ﬁcient to determine the will, then there are practical laws;\\notherwise all practical principles will be mere maxims. Within a pathologi-\\ncallyuaffected will of a rational being there can be found a con ﬂict of maxims\\nwith the practical laws cognized by himself. For example, someone can make\\nit his maxim to let no insult pass unavenged and yet at the same time see that\\nthis is no practical law but only his maxim –that, on the contrary, as being in\\none and the same maxim a rule for the will of every rational being it could not\\nharmonize with itself.

But for a being in whom reaso\\nn quite alone is not the determining\\nground of the will, this rule is an\\nimperative\\n, that is, a rule indicated by an\\n“\\nought,\\n”\\nwhich expresses objective necessitation to the action and signi\\nﬁ\\nes\\nthat if reason completely determined\\nthe will the action would without fail\\ntake place in accordance with this rule.\\nImperatives, therefore, hold objec-\\ntively and are quite distinct from maxim\\ns, which are subjective principles.\\nBut the former either determine the co\\nnditions of the causality of a rational\\nbeing as an ef\\nﬁ\\ncient cause merely with respect to the effect and its adequacy\\nto it or they determine only the will, whether or not it is suf\\nﬁ\\ncient for the\\neffect. The\\nﬁ\\nrst would be hypothetical imper\\natives and would contain mere\\nprecepts of skill; the second, on the contrary, would be categorical and\\nwould alone be practical law\\ns. Thus maxims are indeed\\nprinciples\\nbut not\\nimperatives\\n.

The latter must suf\\nﬁ\\nciently determine the will\\nas will even before I ask whether I ha\\nve the ability required for a desired\\neffect or what I am to do in order to produce it, and must thus be categorical:\\notherwise they are not laws because they lack the necessity which, if it is to\\nbe practical, must be independent of co\\nnditions that are pathological and\\ntherefore only contingently connected with the will. Tell someone, for\\nexample, that he must work and save in his youth in order not to want in\\nhis old age; this is a correct and also important practical precept of the will.\\nBut it is readily seen that here the will is directed to something\\nelse\\nwhich it is\\npresupposed that it desires, and as to th\\nis desire, it must be left to the agent\\nhimself whether he foresees other res\\nources than means acquired by him-\\nself, or does not hope to live to old age,\\nor thinks that in case of future need\\nhe can make do with little. Reason, from which alone can arise any rule that\\nis to contain necessity, does indeed put necessity even into this precept (for\\notherwise it would not be an imperative), though it is only a subjectively\\nconditioned necessity and cannot be presupposed in the same degree in\\n5:21\\nall\\nsubjects. But it is requisite to reason\\n’\\ns lawgiving that it should need to\\npresuppose only\\nitself\\n, because a rule is objectively and universally valid\\nonly when it holds without the conting\\nent, subjective conditions that dis-\\ntinguish one rational being from another.

Otherwise, how could one make a comparison in\\nmagnitude\\nbetween\\ntwo determining grounds quite differen\\nt as to the kind of representation, so\\nas to prefer the one that most affects the faculty of desire? The same human\\nbeing can return unread an instructive book that he cannot again obtain, in\\norder not to miss a hunt; he can leave in the middle of a\\nﬁ\\nne speech in order\\nnot to be late for a meal; he can leave an intellectual conversation, such as he\\notherwise values highly, in order to tak\\ne his place at the gaming table; he can\\neven repulse a poor man whom at other times it is a joy for him to bene\\nﬁ\\nt\\nbecause he now has only enough money in his pocket to pay for his\\nadmission to the theater. If the determin\\nation of his will rests on the feeling\\nof agreeableness or disagreeableness that he expects from some cause, it is\\nall the same to him by what kind of representation he is affected. The\\nonly thing that concerns him, in order to decide upon a choice, is how\\nintense, how long, how easily acquired\\n, and how often repeated this agree-\\nableness is. Just as, to someone who wa\\nnts money to spend it is all the same\\nwhether the material in it, the gold, was dug out of a mountain or washed out\\nof sand provided it is accepted everywhere at the same value, so no one asks,\\nwhen he is concerned only with the agre\\neableness of life, whether repre-\\nsentations belong to the understanding or to the senses but only\\nhow much\\nand\\nhow great\\nsatisfaction they will furnish him for the longest time.

As far as can be conjectured, he\\nsought the source of many of them in the\\nuse of the higher cognitive faculty;\\nbut this did not and could not prevent him from holding, in accordance with\\nthe principle mentioned above, that t\\nhe satisfaction itself which those\\nintellectual representations afford us and by which alone they can be\\ndetermining grounds of the will is of exactly the same kind.\\nConsistency\\nis\\nthe greatest obligation\\nd\\nof a philosopher and yet t\\nhe most rarely found.\\nThe ancient Greek schools give us more examples of it than we\\nﬁ\\nnd in\\nour\\nsyncretistic\\nage, in which a certain\\ncoalition system\\nof contradictory\\nprinciples, replete with dishonesty an\\nd shallowness, is contrived, because\\nit commends itself better t\\no a public that is satis\\nﬁ\\ned with knowing\\nsomething of everything and nothin\\ng as a whole, so that it can turn its\\nhand to anything. The principle of one\\n’\\ns own happiness, however much\\nunderstanding and reason may be used in it, still contains no determining\\nground for the will other than such as is suitable to the\\nlower\\nfaculty of\\ndesire; and thus either there is no higher faculty of desire at all or else\\npure\\nreason\\nm u s tb ep r a c t i c a lo fi t s e l fa n da l o n e ,t h a ti s ,i tm u s tb ea b l et o\\ndetermine the will by the mere form of a\\npractical rule without presupposing\\nany feeling and hence without any repre\\nsentation of the agreeable or dis-\\nagreeable as the matter of the faculty of desire, which is always an empirical\\ncondition of principles.

In a practical law reason de\\ntermines the will immediately, not by\\nmeans of an intervening feeling of pleasure or displeasure, not even in\\nthis law; and that it can as pure reason be practical is what alone makes it\\npossible for it to\\nbe lawgiving\\n.\\nd\\nObliegenheit\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n22Remark II\\nTo be happy is necessarily the demand of every rational but\\nﬁ\\nnite being\\nand therefore an unavoidable determining ground of its faculty of desire.\\nFor, satisfaction with one\\n’\\ns whole existence is not, as it were, an original\\npossession and a beatitude\\ne\\nwhich would presuppose a consciousness of\\none\\n’\\ns independent self-suf\\nﬁ\\nciency, but is instead a problem imposed upon\\nhim by his\\nﬁ\\nnite nature itself, because he is needy and this need is directed\\nto the matter of his faculty of desire, that is, something related to a\\nsubjective feeling of pleasure or displeasure underlying it by which is\\ndetermined what he needs in order to be satis\\nﬁ\\ned with his condition.\\nBut just because this material deter\\nmining ground can be cognized only\\nempirically by the subject, it is impo\\nssible to regard this problem as law,\\nsince a law, as objective, must contain the\\nvery same determining ground\\nof\\nthe will in all cases and for all rational beings. For, although the concept of\\nhappiness\\neverywhere\\nunderlies the practical relation of\\nobjects\\nto the\\nfaculty of desire, it is still only the general name for subjective determining\\ngrounds, and it determines nothing speci\\nﬁ\\nc about it although this is all that\\nmatters in this practical problem and without such determination the\\nproblem cannot be solved at all. That is to say, where each has to put his\\nhappiness comes down to the particular feeling of pleasure and displeasure\\nin each and, even within one and the same subject, to needs that differ as\\nthis feeling changes; and a law that is\\nsubjectively necessary\\n(as a law of\\nnature) is thus\\nobjectively\\nav e r y\\ncontingent\\npractical principle, which can\\nand must be very different in different subjects, and hence can never yield\\na law because, in the desire for happiness, it is not the form of lawfulness\\nthat counts but simply the matter, namely whether I am to expect sat-\\nisfaction from following the law, and how much. Principles of self-love can\\nindeed contain universal rules of skill (for\\nﬁ\\nnding means to one\\n’\\nsp u r p o -\\nses), but in that case they are only theoretical principles* (such\\n5:26\\nas, e.g.,\\nhow someone who would like to eat bread has to construct a mill).

This is either the\\ndetermining ground of the will or it is not. If it is the determining ground of\\nthe will, then the rule of the will is subject to an empirical condition (to the\\nrelation of the determining representation to the feeling of pleasure or dis-\\npleasure), and so is not a practical law. Now, all that remains of a law if one\\nseparates from it everything material, that is, every object of the will (as its\\ndetermining ground), is the mere\\nform\\nof giving universal law. Therefore,\\neither a rational being cannot think of\\nhis\\nsubjectively practical principles, that\\nis, his maxims, as being at the same time universal laws or he must assume that\\ntheir mere form, by which\\nthey are\\nﬁ\\nt for a giving of universal law\\n, of itself and\\nalone makes them practical laws.\\nf\\nsie ist die Wortbestimmung\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n24Remark\\nThe most common understanding can distinguish without instruction what\\nform in a maxim makes it\\nﬁ\\nt for a giving of universal law and what does not. I\\nhave, for example, made it my maxim to increase my wealth by every safe m\\neans.\\nNow I have a\\ndeposit\\nin my hands, the owner of which has died and left no record\\nof it. This is, naturally, a case for my maxim. Now I want only to know whether\\nthat maxim could also hold as a universal practical law. I therefore apply the\\nmaxim to the present case and ask whether it could indeed take the form of a law\\n,\\nand consequently whether I could through my maxim at the same time give such\\na law as this: that everyone may deny a deposit which no one can prove has been\\nmade. I at once become aware that such a principle, as a law, would annihilate\\nitself since it would bring it about that there would be no deposits at all. A\\npractical law that I cognize as such must qualify for a giving of universal l\\naw: this\\nis an identical proposition and therefore self-evident. Now, if I sa\\ny that my will is\\nsubject to a practical\\nlaw\\n, I cannot cite my inclination (e.g., in the present case\\nmy avarice) as the determining ground of my will\\n5:28\\nappropriate to a universal\\npractical law; for this is so far from being quali\\nﬁ\\ned for a giving of universal law\\nthat in the form of a universal law it must instead destroy itself.\\nIt is, therefore, strange that intelligent men could have thought of passing\\noff the desire for happiness as a universal\\npractical law\\non the ground that the\\ndesire, and so too the\\nmaxim\\nby which each makes this desire the determining\\nground of his will, is universal. For whereas elsewhere a universal law of\\nnature makes everything harmonious, here, if one wanted to give the maxim\\nthe universality of a law, the most extreme opposite of harmony would follow,\\nthe worst con\\nﬂ\\nict, and the complete annihilation of the maxim itself and its\\npurpose. For then the will of all has not one and the same object but each has\\nhis own (his own welfare), which can indeed happen to accord with the\\npurposes of others who are likewise pursuing their own but which is far\\nfrom suf\\nﬁ\\ncing for a law because the exceptions that one is warranted in making\\nupon occasion are endless and cannot be determinately embraced in a univer-\\nsal rule. In this way there results a harmony like that which a certain satirical\\npoem depicts in the unanimity between a married couple bent on going to\\nruin:\\n“\\nO marvellous harmony, what he wants she wants too\\n”\\nand so forth, or like\\nwhat is said of the pledge of King Francis I to the Emperor Charles V:\\n“\\nWhat\\nmy brother Charles would have (Milan), that I would also have.\\n”\\nEmpirical\\ndetermining grounds are not\\nﬁ\\nt for any universal external legislation\\ng\\nand are\\nno more\\nﬁ\\nt for internal lawgiving; for each person puts at the basis of\\ninclination his subject\\n–\\nanother person, another subject\\n–\\nand even within\\neach subject now the in\\nﬂ\\nuence of one inclination has priority and now that of\\nanother. To discover a law that under this condition would govern them all\\n–\\nthat is to say, with omnilateral concord\\n–\\nis quite impossible.\\ng\\nallgemeinen äußern Gesetzgebung\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n255.\\nPROBLEM I\\nSupposing that the mere lawgiving form of maxims is the only suf\\nﬁ\\ncient\\ndetermining ground of a will: to\\nﬁ\\nnd the constitution of a will that is deter-\\nminable by it alone.\\nSince the mere form of a law can be r\\nepresented only by reason and is\\ntherefore not an object of the sense\\ns and consequently does not belong\\namong appearances, the representat\\ni o no ft h i sf o r ma st h ed e t e r m i n i n g\\nground of the will is distinct from al\\nl determining grounds of events in\\n5:29\\nnature in accordance with the law of causality, because in their case the\\ndetermining grounds must themselves be appearances. But if no determin-\\ning ground of the will other than that uni\\nversal lawgiving form can serve as a\\nlaw for it, such a will must be thought as altogether independent of the\\nnatural law of appearances in their re\\nlations to one another, namely the law\\nof causality. But such independence is called\\nfreedom\\nin the strictest, that is,\\nin the transcendental, sense. Therefore, a will for which the mere lawgiving\\nform of a maxim can alone serve as a law is a free will.\\n6.\\nPROBLEM II\\nSupposing that a will\\nis free\\n:t o\\nﬁ\\nnd the law that alone is competent to\\ndetermine it necessarily.\\nSince the matter of a practical law, that is, an object of the maxim, can\\nnever be given otherwise than empirically whereas a free will, as independ-\\nent of empirical conditions (i.e., conditions belonging to the sensible world),\\nmust nevertheless be determinable, a free will must\\nﬁ\\nnd a determining\\nground in the law but independently of the\\nmatter\\no ft h el a w .B u t ,b e s i d e s\\nthe matter of the law, nothing further is contained in it than the lawgiving\\nform. The lawgiving form, insofar as this is contained in the maxim, is\\ntherefore the only thing that can constitute a determining ground of\\nthe will.\\nRemark\\nThus freedom and unconditional prac\\ntical law reciprocally imply each\\nother.\\nh\\nNow I do not ask here whether they are in fact different or whether\\nit is not much rather the case that an unconditional law is merely the self-\\nconsciousness of a pure practical reason, this being identical with the\\nh\\nweisen\\n...\\nwechselsweise auf einander zurück\\n. In the\\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n4\\n:\\n450\\n), Kant said that freedom and the lawgiving of one\\n’\\ns own will are both autonomy and hence\\nWechselbegriffe\\n.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n26positive concept of freedom\\n; I ask instead from what our\\ncognition\\nof the\\nunconditionally practical\\nstarts\\n, whether from freedom or from the practical\\nlaw. It cannot start from freedom, for we can neither be immediately\\nconscious of this, since the\\nﬁ\\nrst concept of it is negative, nor can we\\nconclude to it from experience, since experience lets us cognize only the\\nlaw of appearances and hence the mechanism of nature, the direct opposite\\nof freedom. It is therefore the\\nmoral law\\n, of which we become immediately\\nconscious (as soon as we draw up maxims of the will for ourselves), that\\nﬁ\\nrst\\noffers itself to us and,\\ninasmuch as reason presents it as a determining\\nground not to be outweighed by any sensible conditions and\\n5:30\\nindeed quite\\nindependent of them, leads directly to the concept of freedom. But how is\\nconsciousness of that moral law possible? We can become aware of pure\\npractical laws just as we are aware of pur\\ne theoretical principles, by attend-\\ning to the necessity with which reason prescribes them to us and to the\\nsetting aside of all empirical conditi\\nons to which reason directs us. The\\nconcept of a pure will arises from the\\nﬁ\\nrst, as consciousness of a pure\\nunderstanding arises from the latter. That this is the true subordination of\\nour concepts and that morality\\nﬁ\\nrst discloses to us the concept of freedom,\\nso that it is\\npractical reason\\nwhich\\nﬁ\\nrst poses to speculative reason, with this\\nconcept, the most insoluble problem so a\\ns to put it in the greatest perplexity,\\nis clear from the following: that, since nothing in appearances can be\\nexplained by the concept of freedom and there the mechanism of nature\\nmust instead constitute the only guide; since, moreover, the antinomy of\\npure reason when it wants to ascend to the unconditioned in the series of\\ncauses gets it entangled in incomprehensibilities on one side as much as on\\nthe other, whereas the latter (mechanism) is at least useful in the explanation\\nof appearances, one would never have ventured to introduce freedom into\\nscience had not the moral law, and with it practical reason, come in and\\nforced this concept upon us. But experience also con\\nﬁ\\nr m st h i so r d e ro f\\nconcepts in us. Suppose someone asserts\\nof his lustful inclination that, when\\nthe desired object and the opportunity a\\nre present, it is quite irresistible to\\nhim; ask him whether, if a gallows\\nw e r ee r e c t e di nf r o n to ft h eh o u s e\\nwhere he\\nﬁ\\nnds this opportunity and he would be hanged on it immediately\\nafter gratifying his lust, he would not t\\nhen control his inclination. One need\\nnot conjecture very long what he would reply. But ask him whether, if his\\nprince demanded, on pain of the same i\\nmmediate execution, that he give\\nfalse testimony against an honorable man whom the prince would like to\\ndestroy under a plausible pretext, he w\\nould consider it possible to overcome\\nhis love of life, however great it ma\\ny be. He would perhaps not venture to\\nassert whether he would do it or not, bu\\nth em u s ta d m i tw i t h o u th e s i t a t i o n\\nthat it would be possible for him. He judges, therefore, that he can do\\nsomething because he is aware that he ought to do it and cognizes\\nfreedom within him, which, without the moral law, would have remained\\nunknown to him.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n277.\\nFUNDAMENTAL LAW OF PURE PRACTICAL\\nREASON\\nSo act that the maxim of your will could always hold at the same time as a\\nprinciple in a giving of universal law.\\n5:31\\nRemark\\nPure geometry has postulates as practical propositions which, however, cont\\nain\\nnothing further than the presupposition that one\\ncould\\ndo something if it were\\nrequired that one should do it, and these are the only propositions of pure\\ngeometry that concern an existing thing.\\ni\\nThey are thus practical rules under a\\nproblematic condition of the will. Here, however, the rule says: one ought\\nabsolutely to proceed in a certain way. The practical rule is therefore uncondi-\\ntional and so is represented a priori as a categorical practical proposition by\\nwhich the will is objectively determined absolutely and immediately (by the\\npractical rule itself, which accordingly is here a law). For, pure reason,\\npractical\\nof itself\\n, is here immediately lawgiving. The will is thought as independent of\\nempirical conditions and hence, as a pure will, as determined\\nby the mere form of\\nlaw\\n, and this determining ground is regarded as the supreme condition of all\\nmaxims. The thing is strange enough, and has nothing like it in all the rest of our\\npractical cognition. For, the a priori thought of a possible giving of univ\\nersal law,\\nwhich is thus merely problematic, is unconditionally commanded as a law\\nwithout borrowing anything from experience or from some external will. But\\nit is also not a precept in accordance with which an action by which a de\\nsired\\neffect is possible should be done (for then the rule would always be physicall\\ny\\nconditioned); it is instead a rule that determines the will a priori only with\\nrespect to the form of its maxims; and so it is at least not impossible to t\\nhink of a\\nlaw that serves only for the\\nsubjective\\nform of principles as yet a determining\\nground through the\\nobjective\\nform of a law as such. Consciousness of this\\nfundamental law may be called a fact of reason because one cannot reason it\\nout from antecedent data of reason, for example, from consciousness of freedo\\nm\\n(since this is not antecedently given to us) and because it instead forces it\\nself\\nupon us of itself as a synthetic a priori proposition that is not based on any\\nintuition, either pure or empirical, although it would be analytic if the f\\nreedom\\nof the will were presupposed; but for this, as a positive concept, an intell\\nectual\\nintuition would be required, which certainly cannot be assumed here. Howeve\\nr,\\nin order to avoid misinterpretation in regarding this law as\\ngiven\\n,i tm u s tb e\\nnoted carefully that it is not an empirical fact but the sole fact of pure reason\\nwhich, by it, announces itself as originally lawgiving (\\nsic volo, sic jubeo\\n).\\nj\\ni\\nein Dasein\\nj\\nWhat I will, I command ( Juvenal\\nSatire\\n6\\n).\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n28Corollary\\nPure reason is practical of itself alone and gives (to the human being) a\\nuniversal law which we call the\\nmoral law\\n.\\nRemark\\n5:32\\nThe fact mentioned above is undeniable. One need only analyze the judgment\\nthat people pass on the lawfulness of their actions in order to\\nﬁ\\nnd that, whatever\\ninclination may say to the contrary, their reason, incorruptible and self-\\nconstrained, always holds the maxim of the will in an action up to the pure\\nwill, that is, to itself inasmuch as it regards itself as a priori practical. Now\\nthis\\nprinciple of morality, just on account of the universality of the lawgiving th\\nat\\nmakes it the formal supreme determining ground of the will regardless of all\\nsubjective differences, is declared by reason to be at the same time a law fo\\nr all\\nrational beings insofar as they have a will, that is, the ability\\nk\\nto determine their\\ncausality by the representation of rules, hence insofar as they are capabl\\ne of\\nactions in accordance with principles and consequently also in accordance wit\\nh a\\npriori practical principles (for these alone have that necessity which reas\\non\\nrequires for a principle). It is, therefore, not limited to human beings onl\\ny but\\napplies to all\\nﬁ\\nnite beings that have reason and will and even includes the in\\nﬁ\\nnite\\nbeing as the supreme intelligence. In the\\nﬁ\\nrst case, however, the law has the form\\nof an imperative, because in them, as rational beings, one can presuppose a\\npure\\nwill but, insofar as they are beings affected by needs and sensible motives,\\nnot a\\nholy\\nwill, that is, such a will as would not be capable of any maxim con\\nﬂ\\nicting\\nwith the moral law. Accordingly the moral law is for them an\\nimperative\\nthat commands categorically because the law is unconditional; the relation\\nof such a will to this law is\\ndependence\\nunder the name of obligation, which\\nsigni\\nﬁ\\nes a\\nnecessitation\\n, though only by reason and its objective law, to an action\\nwhich is called\\nduty\\nbecause a choice that is pathologically affected (though not\\nthereby determined, hence still free) brings with it a wish arising from\\nsubjective\\ncauses, because of which it can often be opposed to the pure objective determin\\n-\\ning ground and thus needs a resistance of practical reason which, as moral\\nnecessitation, may be called an internal but intellectual constraint. In the\\nsupremely self-suf\\nﬁ\\ncient intelligence, choice is rightly represented as incapable\\nof any maxim that could not at the same time be objectively a law, and the\\nconcept of\\nholiness\\n, which on that account belongs to it, puts it, not indeed above\\nall practical laws, but rather above all practically restrictive laws and so ab\\nove\\nobligation and duty. This holiness of will is nevertheless a practical\\nidea\\n,w h i c h\\nmust necessarily serve as a\\nmodel\\nto which all\\nﬁ\\nnite rational beings can only\\napproximate without end and which the pure moral law, itself called holy\\nbecause of this, constantly and rightly holds before their eyes; the utmost that\\nk\\nVermögen\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n29ﬁ\\nnite practical reason can effect is to make sure\\n5:33\\nof this unending progress of\\none\\n’\\ns maxims toward this model and of their constancy in continual progress,\\nthat is, virtue; and virtue itself, in turn, at least as a naturally acquired ability, ca\\nn\\nnever be completed, because assurance in such a case never becomes apodicti\\nc\\ncertainty and, as persuasion, is very dangerous.\\n8.\\nTHEOREM IV\\nAutonomy\\nof the will is the sole principle of all moral laws and of duties in\\nkeeping with them;\\nheteronomy\\nof choice, on the other hand, not only does not\\nground any obligation at all but is instead opposed to the principle of obliga-\\ntion and to the morality of the will. That is to say, the sole principle of morality\\nconsists in independence from all matter of the law (namely, from a desired\\nobject) and at the same time in the determination of choice through the mere\\nform of giving universal law that a maxim must be capable of. That\\nindepend-\\nence\\n, however, is freedom in the\\nnegative\\nsense, whereas this\\nlawgiving of its\\nown\\nl\\non the part of pure and, as such, practical reason is freedom in the\\npositive\\nsense. Thus the moral law expresses nothing other than the\\nautonomy\\nof pure\\npractical reason, that is, freedom, and this is itself the formal condition of all\\nmaxims, under which alone they can accord with the supreme practical law. If,\\ntherefore, the matter of volition, which can be nothing other than the object of\\na desire that is connected with the law, enters into the practical law\\nas a\\ncondition of its possibility\\n, there results heteronomy of choice, namely depend-\\nence upon the natural law of following some impulse or inclination, and the\\nwill does not give itself the law but only the precept for rationally following\\npathological law; but a maxim which, in this way, can never contain within it\\nthe form of giving universal law not only establishes no obligation but is itself\\nopposed to the principle of a\\npure\\npractical reason and so also to the moral\\ndisposition, even though the action arising from it may be in conformity with\\nthe law.\\nRemark I\\n5:34\\nThus a practical precept that brings with it a material (hence empirical)\\ncondition must never be reckoned a practical law. For, the law of the pure\\nwill, which is free, puts the will in a sphere quite different from the empirical,\\nand the necessity that the law expresses, since it is not to be a natural necessity,\\ncan therefore consist only in the formal conditions of the possibility of a law in\\ngeneral. All the matter of practical rules rests always on subjective conditions,\\nwhich afford it no universality for rational beings other than a merely\\nl\\ndiese eigene Gesetzgebung\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n30conditional one (in case I\\ndesire\\nthis or that, what I would then have to do in\\norder to make it real), and they all turn on the principle\\nof one\\n’\\ns own happiness\\n.\\nNow it is indeed undeniable that every volition must also have an object and\\nhence a matter; but the matter is not, just because of this, the determining\\nground and condition of the maxim; for if it is, then the maxim cannot be\\npresented in the form of giving universal law, since expectation of the\\nexistence of the object would then be the determining cause of choice, and\\nthe dependence of the faculty of desire upon the existence of some thing\\nwould have to be put at the basis of volition; and since this dependence can be\\nsought only in empirical conditions, it can never furnish the basis for a\\nnecessary and universal rule. Thus, the happiness of other beings can be the\\nobject of the will of a rational being. But if it were the determining ground of\\nthe maxim, one would have to presuppose that we\\nﬁ\\nnd not only a natural\\nsatisfaction in the well-being of others but also a need, such as a sympathetic\\nsensibility\\nm\\nbrings with it in human beings. But I cannot presuppose this need\\nin every rational being (not at all in God). Thus the matter of the maxim can\\nindeed remain, but it must not be the condition of the maxim since the maxim\\nwould then not be\\nﬁ\\nt for a law. Hence the mere form of a law, which limits the\\nmatter, must at the same time be a ground for adding this matter to the will but\\nnot for presupposing it. Let the matter be, for example, my own happiness.\\nThis, if I attribute it to each (as, in the case of\\nﬁ\\nnite beings, I may in fact do),\\ncan become an\\nobjective\\npractical law only if I include in it the happiness of\\nothers. Thus the law to promote the happiness of others arises not from the\\npresupposition that this is an object of everyone\\n’\\ns choice but merely from this:\\nthat the form of universality, which reason requires as the condition of giving\\nto a maxim of self-love the objective validity of a law, becomes the determining\\nground of the will; and so the object (the happiness of others) was not the\\ndetermining ground of the pure will; this was, instead, the mere lawful form\\nalone, by which I limited my maxim based on inclination in order to afford it\\nthe\\n5:35\\nuniversality of a law and in this way to make it suitable for pure practical\\nreason; only from this limitation, and not from the addition of an external\\nincentive,\\nn\\ncould there arise the concept of\\nobligation\\nto extend the maxim of\\nmy self-love to the happiness of others as well.\\nRemark II\\nThe direct opposite of the principle of morality is the principle of\\none\\n’\\ns own\\nhappiness made the determining ground of the will; and, as I have shown\\nabove, whatever puts the determining ground that is to serve as a law any-\\nwhere else than in the lawgiving form of the maxim must be counted in this.\\nm\\nSinnesart\\nn\\nTriebfeder\\n.

Or suppose that someone recom\\n-\\nmends to you as steward a man to whom you could blindly trust all your aff\\nairs\\nand, in order to inspire you with con\\nﬁ\\ndence, extols him as a prudent human\\nbeing with masterly understanding of his own advantage and also as an indefat-\\nigably active one, who lets pass no opportunity to advance it; and\\nﬁ\\nnally, lest any\\nconcern about a vulgar sel\\nﬁ\\nshness in him stand in the way, the recommender\\npraises his understanding of how to live with re\\nﬁ\\nnement, seeking his satisfaction\\nnot in making money or in coarse luxury but in enlarging his knowledge, in\\nselect and instructive society, and even in bene\\nﬁ\\ncence to the needy, while as to\\nthe means (which of course derive all their worth or lack of it from the en\\nd) he is\\nnot particular and is ready to use other\\n5:36\\npeople\\n’\\ns money and goods for his end as\\nif they were his own, provided he knows that he can do so without being\\ndiscovered or thwarted; you would believe either that the recommender was\\nmaking a fool of you or that he had lost his mind. So distinctly and sharply\\ndrawn are the boundaries of morality and self-love that even the most comm\\non\\neye cannot fail to distinguish whether something belongs to the one or the ot\\nher.\\nThe few remarks that follow may seem super\\nﬂ\\nuous where the truth is so evident,\\nbut they may serve at least to afford the judgement of common human reason\\nsomewhat greater distinctness.\\nThe principle of happiness can indeed furnish maxims, but never such as\\nwould be\\nﬁ\\nt for laws of the will, even if\\nuniversal\\nhappiness were made the\\nobject. For, because cognition of this rests on sheer data of experience, each\\njudgement about it depending very much upon the opinion of each which is\\nitself very changeable, it can indeed give\\ngeneral\\nrules but never\\nuniversal\\nrules,\\nthat is, it can give rules that on the average are most often correct but not rules\\nthat must hold always and necessarily; hence no practical\\nlaws\\ncan be based on\\nit. Just because an object of choice is here put at the basis of its rule and must\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n32therefore precede it, the rule can be referred to and can be based upon nothing\\nother than what one approves,\\no\\nand so it refers to and is based upon experi-\\nence, and then the variety of judgment must be endless. This principle,\\ntherefore, does not prescribe the very same practical rules to all rational\\nbeings, even though the rules come under a common heading,\\np\\nnamely that\\nof happiness. The moral law, however, is thought as objectively necessary only\\nbecause it is to hold for everyone having reason and will.\\nThe maxim of self-love (prudence) merely\\nadvises\\n; the law of morality\\ncommands\\n. But there is a great difference between that which we are\\nadvised\\nto\\ndo and that to which we are\\nobligated\\n.\\nWhat is to be done in accordance with\\nthe principle of the autonomy of\\nchoice is seen quite easily and witho\\nut hesitation by the most common\\nunderstanding; what is to be done on the presupposition of heteronomy of\\nchoice is dif\\nﬁ\\ncult to see and requires knowledg\\ne of the world; in other words,\\nwhat\\nduty\\nis, is plain of itself to everyone, but what brings true lasting\\nadvantage, if this is to extend to the whole of one\\n’\\nse x i s t e n c e ,i sa l w a y s\\nveiled in impenetrable obscurity, a\\nnd much prudence is required to adapt\\nthe practical rule in accordance with\\nit to the ends of life even tolerably, by\\nmaking appropriate exceptions. Bu\\nt the moral law commands compliance\\nfrom everyone, and indeed the most exa\\nct compliance. Appraising what is to\\nbe done in accordance with it must, therefore, not be so dif\\nﬁ\\ncult that the\\nmost common and unpracticed understanding should not know how to go\\nabout it, even without worldly prudence.\\nTo satisfy the categorical command of morality is within everyone\\n’\\nsp o w e ra t\\nall times; to satisfy the empirically conditioned precept of\\n5:37\\nhappiness is but\\nseldom possible and is far from being possible for everyone even with respec\\nt\\nto only a single purpose. The reason is that in the\\nﬁ\\nrst case it is a question only of\\nthe maxim, which must be genuine and pure, whereas in the latter case it is also\\na\\nquestion of one\\n’\\ns powers and one\\n’\\ns physical ability to make a desired object real.\\nA command that everyone should seek to make himself happy would be foolish,\\nfor one never commands of someone what he unavoidably wants already. One\\nwould have to command of him only the measures\\n–\\nor, better, provide him with\\nthem, since he cannot do all that he wants to do. But to command morality under\\nthe name of duty is quite reasonable; for,\\nﬁ\\nrst, it is not the case that everyone\\nwillingly obeys its precept when it is in con\\nﬂ\\nict with his inclinations; and as for\\nthe measures\\n–\\nhow he can comply with it\\n–\\nhere these need not be taught; for in\\nregard to this, what he wills to do, that he also can do.\\nHe who has\\nlost\\nat play can indeed be\\nchagrined\\nwith himself and his\\nimprudence; but if he is conscious of having\\ncheated\\nat play (although he has\\ngained by it), he must\\ndespise\\nhimself as soon as he compares himself with the\\no\\nemp\\nﬁ\\nehlt\\n. Hartenstein reads\\nemp\\nﬁ\\nndet\\n(feels).\\np\\nTitel\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n33moral law. This must, therefore, be something other than the principle of\\none\\n’\\ns own happiness. For, to have to say to himself\\n“\\nIa ma\\nworthless\\nman\\nq\\nalthough I have\\nﬁ\\nlled my purse,\\n”\\nhe must have a different criterion of judg-\\nment from that by which he commends himself and says\\n“\\nIa ma\\nprudent\\nman,\\nr\\nfor I have enriched my cash box.\\n”\\nFinally there is in the idea of our prac\\ntical reason something further that\\naccompanies the transgression of a moral law, namely its\\ndeserving punish-\\nment\\n. Now, becoming a partaker in happiness cannot be combined with the\\nconcept of a punishment as such. For, although he who punishes can at the\\nsame time have the kindly intention of\\ndirecting the punishment to this end\\nas well, yet it must\\nﬁ\\nrst be justi\\nﬁ\\ned in itself as punishment, that is, as mere\\nharm,\\ns\\nso that he who is punished, if it stopped there and he could see no\\nkindness hidden behind this harshness, m\\nust himself admit that justice was\\ndone to him\\nt\\nand that what was allotted him was perfectly suited to his\\nconduct. In every punishment as such there must\\nﬁ\\nrst be justice,\\nu\\nand this\\nconstitutes what is essential in th\\nis concept. Kindness can, indeed, be\\nconnected with it, but the one who d\\neserves punishment for his conduct\\nhas not the least cause to count on this. Thus punishment is a physical\\nharm that, even if it is not connected with moral wickedness as a\\nnatural\\nconsequence, would still have to be connected with it as a consequence in\\naccordance with the principles of a moral lawgiving. Now if every crime,\\neven without regard to the physical consequence with respect to the agent,\\nis of itself punishable\\n–\\nthat is, forfeits happiness (at least in part)\\n–\\nit would\\nobviously be absurd to say that the c\\nrime consisted just in his having\\nbrought a punishment upon himself and thereby\\n5:38\\ninfringed upon his own\\nhappiness (which, in accordance with the principle of self-love, would have\\nto be the proper concept of all crime). The punishment would in this way\\nbe the ground for calling something a crime, and justice would have to\\nconsist instead in omitting all punishment and even warding off that\\nwhich is natural; for then there would no longer be any wickedness in\\nthe action, since the harm that would otherwise follow upon it and on\\naccount of which alone the action would be called wicked would now be\\nprevented. But to look upon all punishments and rewards as mere machi-\\nnery in the hands of a higher power, serving only to put rational beings\\ninto activity toward their\\nﬁ\\nnal purpose (happiness), is so patently a mech-\\nanism which does away with the freedom of their will that it need not\\ndetain us here.\\nq\\nUnwürdiger\\nr\\nMensch\\ns\\nOr\\n“\\nill-being,\\n”\\nÜbel\\n.

The concept of\\nmorality and duty would therefore have to precede any regard for this\\nsatisfaction and cannot be derived from it. Now, one must\\nﬁ\\nrst value the\\nimportance of what we call duty, the authority of the moral law, and the\\nimmediate worth that compliance with it gives a person in his own eyes, in\\norder to feel that satisfact\\ni o ni nc o n s c i o u s n e s so fo n e\\n’\\nsc o n f o r m i t yw i t hi t\\nand bitter remorse if one can reproach oneself with having transgressed it.\\nThus one cannot feel such satisfaction o\\nr mental unease prior to cognition of\\nobligation and cannot make it the basis of the latter.

For the rest, as the human will is by virtue\\nof its freedom immediately determina\\nble by the moral law, I certainly do not\\ndeny that frequent practice in confor\\nmity with this determining ground can\\nﬁ\\nnally produce subjectively a feeling of satisfaction with oneself; on the\\ncontrary, to establish and to cultivate\\nthis feeling, which alone deserves to be\\ncalled moral feeling strictly speaking,\\nitself belongs to duty; but the concept\\nof duty cannot be derived from it\\n–\\notherwise we should have to think of a\\nfeeling\\n5:39\\nof a law as such\\nw\\nand make what can only be thought by reason an\\nobject of sensation;\\nx\\nand this, if it is not to be a\\nﬂ\\nat contradiction, would\\nquite do away with any concept of duty and put in its place merely a\\nmechanical play of re\\nﬁ\\nned inclinations sometimes contending with the\\ncoarser.\\nIf we now compare our\\nformal\\nsupreme principle of pure practical reason\\n(as that of an autonomy of the will) with all previous\\nmaterial\\nprinciples of\\nmorality, we can set forth all the rest, as such, in a table in which all possible\\ncases are actually exhausted, except the one formal principle; and thus we can\\nprove visually that it is futile to look around for any other principle than that\\nnow presented.

But those in the second\\ngroup are based on reason (for, perfection as a\\ncharacteristic\\nz\\nof things, and the\\nsupreme perfection represented in\\nsubstance\\n, i.e., God, are both to be thought\\nonly by means of rational concepts). However, the\\nﬁ\\nrst concept, namely that of\\nperfection\\n, can be taken either in the\\ntheoretical\\nsense, and then it signi\\nﬁ\\nes\\nnothing other than the completeness of each thing in its kind (transcendental\\nperfection) or of a thing merely as a thing in general (metaphysical perfection),\\nand we are not concerned with that here.

At the same time it shows that this fact is inseparably connected with,\\nand indeed identical with, consciousness of freedom of the will, whereby the\\nwill of a rational being that, as belonging to the sensible world cognizes itself\\nas, like other ef\\nﬁ\\ncient causes, necessarily subject to laws of causality, yet in the\\npractical is also conscious of itself on another side, namely as a being in itself,\\nconscious of its existence as determinable in an intelligible order of things\\n–\\nconscious of this not, indeed, by a special intuition of itself but according to\\ncertain dynamic laws that can determine its causality in the sensible world; for\\nit has been suf\\nﬁ\\nciently proved elsewhere\\n8\\nthat freedom, if it is attributed to us,\\ntransfers us into an intelligible order of things.\\nIf we compare with this Analytic the analytical part of the\\nCritique\\nof pure\\nspeculative reason, we see a contrast between them worth noting. Not prin-\\nciples but instead pure sensible\\nintuition\\n(space and time) was there the\\nﬁ\\nrst\\ndatum that made a priori cognition possible and, indeed, only for objects of the\\nsenses. Synthetic principles from mere concepts without intuition were\\nimpossible; instead, such principles could be had only with reference to\\nintuition, which was sensible, and so only with reference to objects of possible\\nexperience, since the concepts of the understanding joined with such intuition\\nalone make possible that cognition which we call experience. Speculative\\nreason was quite rightly denied anything positive for\\ncognition\\nbeyond objects\\nof experience, hence of things as noumena. Nevertheless, speculative reason\\nwent so far as to secure the concept of noumena\\n–\\nthat is, the possibility and\\nindeed the necessity of thinking them\\n–\\nand, for example, to preserve against\\nall objections the assumption of freedom, regarded negatively, as quite com-\\npatible with those principles and limitations of pure theoretical reason,\\n5:43\\nthough\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n37without letting us cognize anything determinate and enlarging about such\\nobjects, inasmuch as it instead cut off altogether any prospect of that.\\nOn the other hand, the moral law, even though it gives no such\\nprospect\\n,\\nnevertheless provides a fact absolutely inexplicable from any data of the\\nsensible world and from the whole compass of our theoretical use of reason,\\na fact that points to a pure world of the understanding and, indeed, even\\ndetermines\\nit\\npositively\\nand lets us cognize something of it, namely a law.\\nThis law is to furnish the sensible world, as a\\nsensible nature\\n(in what concerns\\nrational beings), with the form of a world of the understanding, that is, of\\na\\nsupersensible\\nnature, though without infringing upon the mechanism of the\\nformer. Now, nature in the most general sense is the existence of things unde\\nr\\nlaws. The sensible nature of rational beings in general is their existence under\\nempirically conditioned laws and is thus, for reason,\\nheteronomy\\n.T h es u p e r -\\nsensible nature of the same beings, on the other hand, is their existence\\nin\\naccordance with laws that are independent of any empirical condition and thus\\nbelong to the\\nautonomy\\nof pure reason. And since the laws by which the\\nexistence of things depends on cognition are practical, supersensible nature\\n,\\nso far as we can make for ourselves a concept of it, is nothing other than\\na nature\\nunder the autonomy of pure practical reason\\n. The law of this autonomy, however, is\\nthe moral law, which is therefore the fundamental law of a supersensible nature\\nand of a pure world of the understanding, the counterpart of which is to exis\\nt in\\nthe sensible world but without infringing upon its laws. The former could be\\ncalled the\\narchetypal world\\n(\\nnatura archetypa\\n) which we cognize only in reason,\\nwhereas the latter could be called the\\nectypal world\\n(\\nnatura ectypa\\n)b e c a u s ei t\\ncontains the possible effect of the idea of the former as the determining ground\\nof the will. For, the moral law in fact transfers us, in idea,\\na\\ninto a nature in which\\npure reason, if it were accompanied with suitable physical power, would p\\nro-\\nduce the highest good, and it determines our will to confer on the sensibl\\ne world\\nthe form of a whole of rational beings.\\nThe most ordinary attention to oneself con\\nﬁ\\nrms that this idea is really, as it\\nwere, the pattern for the determinations of our will.\\nWhen the maxim on which I intend to give testimony is tested by\\n5:44\\npractical\\nreason, I always consider what it would be if it were to hold as a universal law\\nof nature. It is obvious that in this way everyone would be necessitated to\\ntruthfulness. For it cannot hold with the universality of a law of nature that\\nstatements should be allowed as proof and yet be intentionally untrue.\\nSimilarly, the maxim that I adopt with respect to disposing freely of my life\\nis at once determined when I ask myself what it would have to be in order that\\na nature should maintain itself in accordance with such a law. It is obvious that\\nin such a nature no one could end his life\\nat will\\n,\\nb\\nfor such an arrangement\\nwould not be an enduring natural order. And so in all other cases. But in actual\\na\\nder Idee nach\\nb\\nwillkürlich\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n38nature, insofar as it is an object of experience, the free will is not of itself\\ndetermined to such maxims as could of themselves establish a nature in\\naccordance with universal laws, or even to such maxims as could of themselves\\nﬁ\\nt into a nature arranged in accordance with them; they are, instead, private\\ninclinations which do constitute a natural whole in accordance with patho-\\nlogical (physical) laws but not a nature that would be possible only through our\\nwill in accordance with pure practical laws. Yet we are conscious through\\nreason of a law to which all our maxims are subject, as if a natural order must at\\nthe same time arise from our will. This law must therefore be the idea of a\\nnature not given empirically and yet possible through freedom, hence a\\nsupersensible nature to which we give objective reality at least in a practical\\nrespect, since we regard it as an object of our will as pure rational beings.\\nHence the difference between the laws of a nature to which\\nthe will is subject\\nand of a\\nnature which\\nis subject\\nto a will\\n(as far as the relation of the will to its\\nfree actions is concerned) rests on this: that in the former the objects must be\\nthe causes of the representations that determine the will, whereas in the latter\\nthe will is to be the cause of the objects, so that its causality has its determining\\nground solely in the pure faculty of reason, which can therefore also be called a\\npure practical reason.\\nThere are, accordingly, two very different problems: how,\\non the one side\\n,\\npure reason can\\ncognize\\nobjects a priori and how,\\non the other side\\n,i t\\n5:45\\ncan be an\\nimmediate determining ground of the will, that is, of the causality of a rational\\nbeing with respect to the reality of objects (merely through the thought of the\\nuniversal validity of its own maxims as law).\\nThe\\nﬁ\\nrst, as belonging to the\\nCritique\\nof pure speculative reason, requires\\nthat it\\nﬁ\\nrst be explained how intuitions, without which no object at all can be\\ngiven and without which, therefore, none can be cognized synthetically, are\\npossible a priori; and its solution turns out to be that these are without\\nexception sensible only and therefore do not make possible any speculative\\ncognition that would go further than possible experience reaches and, con-\\nsequently, that all principles of that pure speculative reason do no more than\\nmake experience possible, either of given objects or of those that may be given\\nto us ad in\\nﬁ\\nnitum but are never completely given.\\nThe second, which belongs to the\\nCritique of Practical Reason\\n, requires no\\nexplanation of how objects of the faculty of desire are possible, for that, as a\\nproblem of theoretical cognition of nature, is left to the\\nCritique\\nof speculative\\nreason, but only how reason can determine maxims of the will, whether this\\ntakes place only by means of empirical representations as determining\\ngrounds, or whether pure reason might also be practical and might be a law\\nof a possible order of nature not empirically cognizable. The possibility of\\nsuch a supersensible nature, the concept of which can also be the ground of its\\nreality through our free will, requires no a priori intuition (of an intelligible\\nworld), which in this case, as supersensible, would also have to be impossible\\nfor us. For it is a question only of the determining ground of volition in\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n39maxims of volition, whether it is empirical or whether it is a concept of pure\\nreason (of its lawfulness in general), and how it can be the latter. Whether the\\ncausality of the will is adequate for the reality of the objects or not is left to the\\ntheoretical principles of reason to estimate, this being an investigation into the\\npossibility of objects of volition, the intuition of which is accordingly no\\ncomponent of the practical problem. It is here a question only of the deter-\\nmination of the will and of the determining ground of its maxims as a free will,\\nnot of its result. For, provided that the will conforms to the law of pure reason,\\nthen\\n5:46\\nits power in execution\\nc\\nmay be as it may, and a nature may or may not\\nactually arise in accordance with these maxims of giving law for a possible\\nnature; the\\nCritique\\nwhich investigates whether and how reason can be\\npractical, that is, whether and how it can determine the will immediately,\\ndoes not trouble itself with this.\\nIn this undertaking the\\nCritique\\ncan therefore not be censured for begin-\\nning with pure practical laws and their reality, and it must begin there. Instead\\nof intuition, however, it takes as their basis the concept of their existence in the\\nintelligible world, namely the concept of freedom. For this concept means\\nnothing else, and those laws are possible only in relation to the freedom of the\\nwill; but on the presupposition of freedom they are necessary or, conversely,\\nfreedom is necessary because those laws are necessary, as practical postulates.\\nHow this consciousness of moral laws or, what is the same thing, this con-\\nsciousness of freedom is possible cannot be further explained; its admissibility\\ncan, however, be defended in the theoretical\\nCritique\\n.\\nThe\\nexposition\\nof the supreme principle of practical reason is now\\nﬁ\\nnished,\\nthat is, it has been shown,\\nﬁ\\nrst, what it contains, that it stands of itself\\nd\\naltogether a priori and independently of empirical principles, and then what\\ndistinguishes it from all other practical principles. With the\\ndeduction\\n, that is,\\nthe justi\\nﬁ\\ncation of its objective and universal validity and the discernment\\ne\\nof\\nthe possibility of such a synthetic proposition a priori, one cannot hope to get\\non so well as was the case with the principles of the pure theoretical under-\\nstanding. For, these referred to objects of possible experience, namely appear-\\nances, and it could be proved that these appearances could be\\ncognized\\nas\\nobjects of experience only by being brought under the categories in accord-\\nance with these laws and consequently that all possible experience must\\nconform to these laws. But I cannot take such a course in the deduction of\\nthe moral law. For, the moral law is not concerned with cognition of the\\nconstitution of objects that may be given to reason from elsewhere but rather\\nwith a cognition insofar as it can itself become the ground of the existence of\\nobjects and insofar as reason, by this cognition, has causality in a rational\\nc\\nVermögen\\n...\\nin der Ausführung\\nd\\nfur sich bestehe\\ne\\nEinsicht\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n40being, that is, pure reason, which can be regarded as a faculty immediately\\ndetermining the will.\\nBut all human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at basic powers\\nor basic faculties\\nf\\nfor there is nothing through which their possibility\\n5:47\\ncan be\\nconceived, and yet it may not be invented and assumed at one\\n’\\ns discretion.\\nTherefore, in the theoretical use of reason only experience can justify us in\\nassuming them. But this substitute, adducing empirical proofs in place of a\\ndeduction from sources of cognition a priori, is also denied us here with\\nrespect to the pure practical faculty of reason. For, whatever needs to draw\\nthe evidence for its reality from experience must be dependent for the grounds\\nof its possibility upon principles of experience, whereas pure but practical\\nreason, by its very concept, cannot possibly be held to be dependent in this\\nway. Moreover the moral law is given, as it were, as a fact of pure reason of\\nwhich we are a priori conscious and which is apodictically certain, though it be\\ngranted that no example of exact observance of it can be found in experience.\\nHence the objective reality of the moral law cannot be proved by any deduc-\\ntion, by any efforts of theoretical reason, speculative or empirically supported,\\nso that, even if one were willing to renounce its apodictic certainty, it could not\\nbe con\\nﬁ\\nrmed by experience and thus proved a posteriori; and it is nevertheless\\nﬁ\\nrmly established of itself.\\nBut something different and quite paradoxical\\ng\\ntakes the place of this vainly\\nsought deduction of the moral principle, namely that the moral principle,\\nconversely itself serves as the principle of the deduction of an inscrutable\\nfaculty which no experience could prove but which speculative reason had to\\nassume as at least possible (in order to\\nﬁ\\nnd among its cosmological ideas what\\nis unconditioned in its causality, so as not to contradict itself), namely the\\nfaculty of freedom, of which the moral law, which itself has no need of\\njustifying grounds, proves not only the possibility but the reality in beings\\nwho cognize this law as binding upon them. The moral law is, in fact, a law of\\ncausality through freedom and hence a law of the possibility of a supersensible\\nnature, just as the metaphysical law of events in the sensible world was a law of\\nthe causality of sensible nature; and the moral law thus determines that which\\nspeculative philosophy had to leave undetermined, namely the law for a\\ncausality the concept of which was only negative in the latter, and thus for\\nthe\\nﬁ\\nrst time provides objective reality to this concept.\\n5:48\\nThis kind of credential of the moral law\\n–\\nthat it is itself laid down as a\\nprinciple of the deduction of freedom as a causality of pure reason\\n–\\nis fully\\nsuf\\nﬁ\\ncient in place of any a priori justi\\nﬁ\\ncation, since theoretical reason was\\nforced\\nto assume\\nat least the possibility of freedom in order to\\nﬁ\\nll a need of its\\nown. For, the moral law proves its reality, so as even to satisfy the\\nCritique\\nof\\nspeculative reason, by adding a positive determination to a causality thought\\nf\\nGrundkräften oder Grundvermögen\\ng\\nWidersinnisches\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n41only negatively, the possibility of which was incomprehensible to speculative\\nreason, which was nevertheless forced to assume it; it adds, namely, the\\nconcept of a reason determining the will immediately (by the condition of a\\nuniversal lawful form of its maxims), and thus is able for the\\nﬁ\\nrst time to give\\nobjective though only practical reality to reason, which always became extrav-\\nagant when it wanted to proceed speculatively with its ideas, and changes its\\ntranscendent\\nuse into an\\nimmanent\\nuse (in which reason is by means of ideas\\nitself an ef\\nﬁ\\ncient cause in the\\nﬁ\\neld of experience).\\nThe determination of the causality of beings in the sensible world can as\\nsuch never be unconditioned, and yet for every series of conditions there must\\nnecessarily be something unconditioned and so too a causality that is alto-\\ngether self-determining. Hence the idea of freedom as a faculty of absolute\\nspontaneity was not a need but,\\nas far as its possibility is concerned\\n, an analytic\\nprinciple of pure speculative reason. It is, however, absolutely impossible to\\ngive anywhere in experience an example of it, since among the causes of things\\nas appearances no determination of causality that would be absolutely uncon-\\nditioned can be found; hence we could\\ndefend\\nthe\\nthought\\nof a freely acting\\ncause, when we apply this to a being in the sensible world, only insofar as this\\nbeing is also regarded on the other side as a noumenon, by showing that it is\\nnot self-contradictory to regard all its actions as physically conditioned insofar\\nas they are appearances and yet also to regard their causality as physically\\nunconditioned insofar as the acting being is a being of the understanding\\nh\\nand\\nthus making the concept of freedom a regulative principle of reason; by it I do\\nnot cognize at all the object to which such causality is attributed\\n–\\nwhat the\\nobject may be\\n–\\nbut I nevertheless remove the obstacle inasmuch as on the one\\nside, in the explanation of events in the world and so too of the actions of\\nrational beings, I grant the mechanism of natural necessity the\\n5:49\\njustice of going\\nback from the conditioned to the condition ad in\\nﬁ\\nnitum, while on the other\\nside I keep open for speculative reason the place which for it is vacant, namely\\nthe intelligible, in order to transfer the unconditioned into it. But I could not\\nrealize\\nthis\\nthought\\n, that is, could not convert it into\\ncognition\\nof a being acting\\nin this way, not even of its mere possibility. Pure practical reason now\\nﬁ\\nlls this\\nvacant place with a determinate law of causality in an intelligible world\\n(with freedom), namely the moral law. By this, speculative reason does not\\ngain anything with respect to its insight but it still gains something only with\\nrespect to the\\nsecurity\\nof its problematic concept of freedom, which is here\\nafforded\\nobjective\\nand, though only practical, undoubted\\nreality\\n. Even the\\nconcept of causality, which has application and so too signi\\nﬁ\\ncance strictly\\nspeaking\\ni\\nonly in reference to appearances, in order to connect them into\\nexperiences (as the\\nCritique of Pure Reason\\nproves) is not enlarged in such a\\nway as to extend its use beyond the boundaries mentioned. For, if reason\\nh\\nVerstandeswesen\\ni\\ndessen Anwendung, mithin auch Bedeutung eigentlich nur\\n...\\nstatt\\nﬁ\\nndet\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n42sought to do this it would have to try to show how the logical relation of\\nground and consequence could be used synthetically with a kind of intuition\\ndifferent from the sensible, that is, how a\\ncausa noumenon\\nis possible; this it\\ncannot do, but as practical reason it does not even concern itself with this\\ninasmuch as it only puts the\\ndetermining ground\\nof the causality of the human\\nbeing as a sensible being (which is given)\\nin pure reason\\n(which is therefore\\ncalled practical), and accordingly uses the concept of cause itself\\n–\\nfrom whose\\napplication to objects for theoretical cognition it can here abstract altogether\\n(since this concept is always found a priori in the understanding, even\\nindependently of any intuition)\\n–\\nnot in order to cognize objects but to\\ndetermine causality with respect to objects in general, and so for none other\\nthan a practical purpose; and thus it can transfer the determining ground of\\nthe will into the intelligible order of things inasmuch as it readily admits at the\\nsame time that it does not understand how the concept of cause might be\\ndetermined for cognition of these things. It must, of course, cognize in a\\ndeterminate way causality with respect to the actions of the will in the sensible\\nworld, since otherwise practical reason could not actually produce any deed.\\nBut as for the concept which it\\n5:50\\nmakes of its own causality as noumenon, it need\\nnot determine it theoretically with a view to cognition of its supersensible\\nexistence and so need not be able to give it signi\\nﬁ\\ncance in this way. For, the\\nconcept receives signi\\nﬁ\\ncance apart from this\\n–\\nthough only for practical use\\n–\\nnamely, through the moral law. Even regarded theoretically it always remains\\na pure concept of the understanding given a priori, which can be applied to\\nobjects whether they are given sensibly or not sensibly, although in the latter\\ncase it has not determinate theoretical signi\\nﬁ\\ncance or application but is merely\\nthe understanding\\n’\\ns formal though still essential thought of an object in\\ngeneral. The signi\\nﬁ\\ncance which reason furnishes it through the moral law is\\nsolely practical, namely that the idea of the law of a causality (of the will) itself\\nhas causality or is its determining ground.\\nII.\\nON THE WARRANT OF PURE REASON IN ITS\\nPRACTICAL USE TO AN EXTENSION WHICH IS\\nN O TP O S S I B L ET OI TI NI T SS P E C U L A T I V EU S E\\nIn the moral principle we have presented a law of causality which puts the\\ndetermining ground of the latter above all conditions of the sensible world;\\nand as for the will and hence the subject of this will (the human being)\\nj\\nwe have\\nnot merely\\nthought\\nit, as it is determinable inasmuch as it belongs to an\\nintelligible world, as belonging to a world of pure understanding though in\\nthis relation unknown to us (as can happen according to the\\nCritique\\nof\\nj\\nI take the pronouns in the rest of this sentence to refer to\\n“\\nthe will,\\n”\\nalthough\\n“\\nthe human being\\n”\\nis a possible referent.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n43speculative reason): we have also\\ndetermined\\nit with respect to its causality by\\nmeans of a law that cannot be counted as any natural law of the sensible world;\\nand thus we have\\nextended\\nour cognition beyond the boundaries of the latter, a\\nclaim that the\\nCritique of Pure Reason\\ndeclared void in all speculation. How,\\nthen, is the practical use of pure reason here to be united\\nk\\nwith its theoretical\\nuse with respect to determining the boundaries of its competence?\\nl\\nDavid Hume, who can be said to have really begun all the assaults on the\\nrights of pure reason which made a thorough investigation of them necessary,\\nconcluded as follows. The concept of\\ncause\\nis a concept that contains the\\nnecessity\\nof the connection of the existence of what is different\\n5:51\\njust insofar as it is different,\\nso that if A is posited I cognize that something altogether different from\\nit, B,\\nmust necessarily also exist. But necessity can be attributed to a connecti\\non only\\ninsofar as the connection is cognized a priori; for, experience would\\nenable us to\\ncognize of such a conjunction\\nm\\nonly that it is, not that it is necessarily so. Now it\\nis impossible, he says, to cognize a priori and as necessary the connectio\\nn\\nbetween one thing and\\nanother\\n(or between one determination and another\\naltogether different from it) if they are not given in perception. Therefo\\nre the\\nconcept of a cause is itself fraudulent and deceptive and, to speak of it in t\\nhe\\nmildest way, an illusion to be excused insofar as the\\ncustom\\nn\\n(a\\nsubjective\\nnecessity) of perceiving certain things or their determinations as often asso\\nciated\\nalong with or after one another in their existence is insensibly tak\\nen for an\\nobjective\\nnecessity of putting such a connection in the objects themselves; and\\nthus the concept of a cause is acquired surreptitiously and not rightfully\\n–\\nindeed, it can never be acquired or certi\\nﬁ\\ned because it demands a connection in\\nitself void, chimerical, and untenable before reason, one to which no obje\\nct can\\never correspond. So, with respect to all cognition having to do with the e\\nxistence\\nof things (mathematics thus remaining excepted)\\nempiricism\\nwas\\nﬁ\\nrst introduced\\nas the sole source of principles, but along with it the most rigorous\\nskepticism\\nwith respect to the whole of natural science (as philosophy). For, on such\\nprinciples we can never\\ninfer\\na consequence from the given determinations of\\nthings as existing (since for this the concept of a cause, which contains the\\nnecessity of such a connection, would be required) but can only expect, by the\\nrule of imagination, cases similar to preceding ones, though this expectation is\\nnever secure however often it is ful\\nﬁ\\nlled. Of no event could one say: something\\nmust\\nhave preceded it, upon which it\\nnecessarily followed, that is, it must have a\\ncause;\\nand thus, however frequent the cases one knew of in which there was such\\nan antecedent, so that a rule could be derived from them, one could still not, on\\naccount of this, assume it as always and necessarily happening in this way, and\\none would also have to give blind chance its right, with which all use of reason\\nk\\nvereinigt,\\nperhaps\\n“\\nreconciled\\n”\\nl\\nihres Vermögens\\nm\\nVerbindung\\nn\\nOr\\n“\\nhabit,\\n”\\nGewohnheit\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n44ceases; and this\\nﬁ\\nrmly grounds and makes irrefutable skepticism with respect to\\ninferences rising\\n5:52\\nfrom effects to causes.\\nMathematics escaped well so far because Hume held that its propositions\\nwere all analytic, that is, proceeded from one determination to another by\\nvirtue of identity and consequently by the principle\\no\\nof contradiction (but this\\nis false since they are instead all synthetic; and although, e.g., geometry does\\nnot have to do with the existence of things but only with their determination a\\npriori in a possible intuition, it nevertheless passes, just as through the causal\\nconcept, from one determination (A) to another altogether different one (B) as\\nstill necessarily connected with the former). But in the end that science, so\\nhighly esteemed for its apodictic certainty, must also succumb to\\nempiricism in\\nprinciples\\non the same ground on which Hume put custom in the place of\\nobjective necessity in the concept of cause; despite all its pride, it must consent\\nto lower its bold claims commanding a priori assent and expect approval of the\\nuniversal validity of its propositions from the kindness of observers who, as\\nwitnesses, would not refuse to admit that what the geometer propounds as\\nprinciples they have always perceived as well, and who would therefore allow\\nit to be expected in the future even though it is not necessary. In this way\\nHume\\n’\\ns empiricism in principles also leads unavoidably to skepticism even\\nwith respect to mathematics and consequently in every\\nscienti\\nﬁ\\nc\\ntheoretical use\\nof reason (for this belongs either to philosophy or to mathematics). I leave each\\nto appraise for himself whether (in view of such a terrible downfall of the chief\\nbranches of cognition) the common use of reason will come through any better\\nand will not instead become irretrievably entangled in this same destruction of\\nall science, so that from the same principles a\\nuniversal\\nskepticism will have to\\nfollow (though it would, admittedly, concern only the learned).\\nAs for my labor in the\\nCritique of Pure Reason\\n, which was occasioned by that\\nHumean skeptical teaching but went much further and included the whole\\nﬁ\\neld of pure theoretical reason in its synthetic use and so too the\\n5:53\\nﬁ\\neld of what is\\ngenerally called metaphysics, I proceeded as follows with respect to the doubt\\nof the Scottish philosopher concerning the concept of causality. When Hume\\ntook objects of experience as things in themselves (as is done almost every-\\nwhere) he was quite correct in declaring the concept of cause to be deceptive\\nand a false illusion; for, as to things in themselves and the determinations of\\nthem as such, it cannot be seen why, because something, A, is posited, some-\\nthing else, B, must necessarily be posited also, and thus he could certainly not\\nadmit such an a priori cognition of things in themselves. Still less could this\\nacute man grant an empirical origin of this concept, since this directly contra-\\ndicts the necessity of the connection that constitutes what is essential in the\\nconcept of causality; hence the concept was proscribed and into its place\\nstepped custom in observation of the course of perceptions.\\no\\nSatze\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n45From my investigations, however, it resulted that the objects with which\\nwe have to do in experience are by no means things in themselves but only\\nappearances and that, although in the case of things in themselves it is not to be\\nunderstood and is indeed impossible to see\\np\\nhow, if A is posited it should be\\ncontradictory\\nnot to posit B which is quite different from A (the necessity of the\\nconnection between A as cause and B as effect), yet it can very well be thought\\nthat as appearances they must necessarily be connected\\nin one experience\\nin a\\ncertain way (e.g., with respect to temporal relations) and cannot be separated\\nwithout\\ncontradicting\\nthat connection by means of which this experience is\\npossible, in which they are objects and in which alone they are cognizable by\\nus. And it was found to be so in fact as well; and thus I was able not only to\\nprove the objective reality of the concept of cause with respect to objects of\\nexperience but also to\\ndeduce\\nit as an a priori concept because of the necessity\\nof the connection that it brings with it, that is, to show its possibility from pure\\nunderstanding without empirical sources; and thus, after removing empiri-\\ncism from its origin, I was able to overthrow the unavoidable consequence of\\nempiricism, namely skepticism\\nﬁ\\nrst with respect to natural science and then,\\nbecause skepticism in mathematics follows from just the same grounds, with\\nrespect to mathematics as well, both of which sciences have reference to\\nobjects of possible experience; in this way I was able to eradicate total doubt\\nof whatever theoretical reason\\n5:54\\nprofesses to have insight into.\\nBut how is it with the application of this category of causality (and so too of\\nall the others, for without them no cognition can be had of what exists) to\\nthings that are not objects of possible experience but lie beyond its bounda-\\nries? For I was able to deduce the objective reality of these concepts only with\\nrespect to\\nobjects of possible experience\\n. But what gives them a place in the pure\\nunderstanding, from which they are referred to objects in general (whether\\nsensible or not) is just this: that I also saved them only in case I proved that\\nobjects may nevertheless be\\nthought\\nthrough them although not determined a\\npriori. If anything is still wanting, it is the condition\\nfor the application\\nof these\\ncategories and especially that of causality to objects, namely intuition; where\\nthis is not given, application with\\na view to theoretical cognition\\nof an object as a\\nnoumenon is made impossible, so that such cognition, when someone ven-\\ntures upon it, is altogether forbidden (as also happens in the\\nCritique of Pure\\nReason\\n), while the objective reality of the concept (of causality) nevertheless\\nremains and can be used even of noumena, although this concept cannot be\\ntheoretically determined in the least and thereby produce a cognition. For,\\nthat this concept, even in relation to an object, contains nothing impossible\\nwas proved by this: that in any application to objects of the senses, its seat in\\nthe pure understanding was secured; and even though, when it might sub-\\nsequently be referred to things in themselves (which cannot be objects of\\np\\nnicht abzusehen ist, ja unmöglilch ist einzusehen\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n46experience), it is not capable of being determined so as to represent\\na\\ndeterminate object\\nfor the sake of theoretical cognition, yet for the sake of\\nsomething else (the practical, perhaps) it could be capable of being determined\\nfor its application; and this would not be the case if, as Hume maintained, this\\nconcept of causality contained something that it is always impossible to think.\\nIn order now to discover this condition of the application of the concept in\\nquestion to noumena, we need only recall\\nwhy we are not satis\\nﬁ\\ned with its\\napplication to objects of experience\\nbut would like to use it of things in them-\\nselves as well. For then it soon becomes apparent that it is not a theoretical but\\na practical purpose that makes this a necessity for us. Even\\n5:55\\nif we were\\nsuccessful in this application we would still have made no true acquisition\\nfor speculation, in cognition of nature or, in general, with respect to any\\nobjects that might be given to us; instead we would at most have taken a\\nlong step from the sensibly conditioned (and we already have enough to do to\\nremain in it and diligently go through the chain of causes) to the supersensible,\\nin order to complete our cognition on the side of grounds and to\\nﬁ\\nx its\\nboundary, although an in\\nﬁ\\nnite gulf between that boundary and what we\\nknow remains always un\\nﬁ\\nlled and we would have listened to a frivolous\\ncuriosity rather than a solid desire for knowledge.\\nHowever, besides the relation in which the\\nunderstanding\\nstands to objects (in\\ntheoretical cognition) it has also a relation to the faculty of de\\nsire, which is\\ntherefore called the will and is called the pure will insofar as the pure under-\\nstanding (which in this case is called reason) is practical through the mere\\nrepresentation of a law. The objective reality of a pure will or, what is the same\\nthing, of a pure practical reason is given a priori in the moral law, as it were by a\\nfact\\n–\\nfor so we may call a determination of the will that is unavoidable even\\nthough it does not rest upon empirical principles. In the concept of a will,\\nhowever, the concept of causality is already contained, and thus in the concept\\nof a pure will there is contained the concept of a causality with freedom, that is, a\\ncausality that is not determinable in accordance with laws of nature and hence not\\ncapable of any empirical intuition as proof of its reality, but that nevertheless\\nperfectly justi\\nﬁ\\nes its objective reality a priori in the pure practical law, though not\\n(as is easily seen) with a view to the theoretical use of reason but only to its\\npractical use. Now, the concept of a being that has free will is the concept of a\\ncausa noumenon;\\nand one is already assured that this concept does not contradict\\nitself since the concept of a cause, as having arisen wholly from the pure under-\\nstanding, also has its objective reality with respect to objects in general assured by\\nthe deduction inasmuch as, being in it\\ns origin independent of all sensible\\nconditions and so of itself not restricted to phenomena (unless one should want\\nto make a determinate theoretical use of it), the concept could certainly be applied\\nto things as beings of the pure understanding. But because no intuition, which\\ncan only be sensible, can be put under this application,\\ncausa noumenon\\nwith\\nrespect to the theoretical use of reason is, though a possible, thinkable concept,\\nnevertheless an empty\\n5:56\\none. But I do not now claim\\nto know theoretically\\nby this\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n47concept the constitution of a being\\ninsofar as\\nit has a\\npure\\nwill; it is enough for me\\nto thereby only designate it as such a being and hence only to connect the concept\\nof causality with that of freedom (and with what is inseparable from it, the moral\\nlaw as its determining ground); and I am certainly authorized to do so by virtue of\\nthe pure, not empirical origin of the concept of cause, inasmuch as I consider\\nmyself authorized to make no other use of it than with regard to the moral law\\nwhich determines its reality, that is, only a practical use.\\nHad I, with Hume, deprived the concept of causality of objective reality in\\nits practical\\nq\\nuse not only with respect to things in themselves (the super-\\nsensible) but also with respect to objects of the senses, it would be declared\\ndevoid of all meaning and, as a theoretically impossible concept, quite unus-\\nable; and since no use at all can be made of what is nothing,\\nr\\nthe practical use of\\na concept\\ntheoretically null\\nwould have been absurd. Now, however, the\\nconcept of an empirically unconditioned causality is indeed theoretically\\nempty (without any intuition appropriate to it) but it is nevertheless possible\\nand refers to an undetermined object; in place of that, however, the concept is\\ngiven signi\\nﬁ\\ncance in the moral law and consequently in its practical reference;\\nthus I have, indeed, no intuition that would determine its objective theoretical\\nreality for it, but it has nonetheless a real application which is exhibited\\nin\\nconcreto\\nin dispositions or maxims, that is, it has practical reality which can be\\nspeci\\nﬁ\\ned; and this is suf\\nﬁ\\ncient to justify it even with regard to noumena.\\nBut this objective reality of a pure concept of the understanding in the\\nﬁ\\neld\\nof the supersensible, once introduced, gives all the other categories objective\\nreality as well, though only insofar as they stand in\\nnecessary\\nconnection with\\nthe determining ground of the pure will (the moral law)\\n–\\nan objective reality\\nwhich is, however, of only practical applicability and has not the least in\\nﬂ\\nuence\\non theoretical cognition of these objects, as insight into their nature by pure\\nreason, so as to extend this. As we shall also\\nﬁ\\nnd in the sequel, these categories\\nhave reference only to beings as\\nintelligences\\n, and in them only to the relation of\\nreason\\nto the\\nwill\\nand consequently always to the\\npractical\\nonly, and beyond\\nthis they lay claim to\\n5:57\\nno cognition of these beings; as for whatever other\\nproperties, belonging to the theoretical way of representing such supersen-\\nsible things, may be brought forward in connection with these categories,\\nthese are without exception to be counted not as knowledge but only as a\\nwarrant (for practical purposes, however, a necessity) to admit and presuppose\\nthem, even where supersensible beings (such as God) are assumed by analogy,\\nthat is, by a purely rational relation of which we make a practical use with\\nrespect to what is sensible; and so, by this application to the supersensible but\\nonly for practical purposes, pure theoretical reason is not given the least\\nencouragement to\\nﬂ\\ny into the transcendent\\ns\\nq\\nVorländer amends this to read\\nim theoretischen Gebrauche\\n,\\n“\\nin its theoretical use.\\n”\\nr\\nvon Nichts\\ns\\nzum Schwärmen ins Überschwengliche\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n48The analytic of practical reason\\nChapter II\\nOn the concept of an object of pure practical reason\\nBy a concept of an object of practical reason I understand the representation of\\nan object as an effect possible through freedom. To be an object of practical\\ncognition so understood signi\\nﬁ\\nes, therefore, only the relation of the will to the\\naction by which it or its opposite would be made real, and to appraise whether\\nor not something is an object of\\npure\\npractical reason is only to distinguish the\\npossibility or impossibility of\\nwilling\\nthe action by which, if we had the ability\\nto do so (and experience must judge about this), a certain object would be\\nmade real. If the object is taken as the determining ground of our faculty of\\ndesire, the\\nphysical possibility\\nof it by the free use of our powers must precede\\nour appraisal of whether it is an object of practical reason or not. On the other\\nhand, if the a priori law can be regarded as the determining ground of the\\naction, and this, accordingly, can be regarded as determined by pure practical\\nreason, then the\\n5:58\\njudgment whether or not something is an object of pure\\npractical reason is quite independent of this comparison with our physical\\nability, and the question is only whether we could\\nwill\\nan action which is\\ndirected to the existence of an object if the object were within our power;\\nt\\nhence the\\nmoral possibility\\nof the action must come\\nﬁ\\nrst, since in this case the\\ndetermining ground of the will is not the object but the law of the will.\\nThe only objects of a practical reason are therefore those of the\\ngood\\nand the\\nevil\\n.

Now because it is\\nimpossible to see a priori which representation will be accompanied with\\npleasure\\nand which with\\ndispleasure\\n, it would be up to experience alone to\\nmake out what is immediately good or evil. The property of the subject, with\\nreference to which alone this experience can be had, is the\\nfeeling\\nv\\nof pleasure\\nand displeasure, as a receptivity belonging to inner sense, and thus the concept\\nof that which is immediately good would be directed only to that with which\\nthe feeling of\\ngrati\\nﬁ\\ncation\\nw\\nis immediately connected, and the concept of the\\nsimply evil would have to be referred only to that which immediately excites\\nt\\nin unserer Gewalt\\nu\\ndes Begehrungs\\n–\\n...\\ndes Verabscheuungsvermögen\\nv\\nGefühl\\nw\\nEmp\\nﬁ\\nndung des Vergnügens\\n.

But since this is opposed even to the use of language, which distin-\\nguishes the\\nagreeable\\nfrom the\\ngood\\nand the\\ndisagreeable\\nfrom the\\nevil\\nand\\nrequires that good and evil always be appraised by reason and hence\\nthrough concepts, which can be unive\\nrsally communicated, not through\\nmere feeling, which is restricted to individual subjects and their receptivity;\\nand since, nevertheless, pleasure or di\\nspleasure cannot of themselves be\\nconnected a priori with any representation of an object, a philosopher who\\nbelieved that he had to put a feeling of pleasure at the basis of his practical\\nappraisal would have to call\\ngood\\nthat which is a\\nmeans\\nto the agreeable, and\\nevil\\nthat which is a cause of disagreeableness and of pain; for, appraisal of\\nthe relation of means to ends certainly belongs to reason. But, although\\nreason alone is capable of discerning the connection of means with their\\npurposes (so that the will could also be de\\nﬁ\\nned as the faculty of ends,\\ninasmuch as these are always determining grounds of\\n5:59\\nthe faculty of desire in\\naccordance with principles), the practical maxims that would follow from\\nthe above concept of the good merely as a means would never contain as the\\nobject of the will anything good in itself, but always only good\\nfor something\\n;\\nthe good would always be merely the useful, and that for which it is useful\\nwould always have to lie outside the will, in feeling. Now if the latter, as\\nagreeable feeling, had to be distinguished from the concept of the good,\\nthen there would be nothing at all immediately good, and the good would\\nhave to be sought, instead, only in the means to something else, namely\\nsome agreeableness.\\nThere is an old formula of the schools,\\nnihil appetimus, nisi sub ratione boni;\\nnihil aversamur, nisi sub ratione mali\\nx\\nand it has a use which is often correct but\\nalso often very detrimental to philosophy, because the expressions\\nboni\\nand\\nmali\\ncontain an ambiguity\\ny\\nowing to the poverty of the language, by which\\nthey are capable of a double sense and thus unavoidably involve practical laws\\nin ambiguities,\\nz\\nand the philosophy which, in using them, becomes aware of\\nthe difference of concepts in the same word but can still\\nﬁ\\nnd no special\\nexpressions for them is forced into subtle distinctions about which there is\\nsubsequently no agreement inasmuch as the difference cannot be directly\\nindicated by any suitable expression.*\\nThe German language has the good fortune to possess expressions which\\ndo not allow this difference to be overlooked.

From this\\nit already follows that the above psychological proposition is at least very\\ndoubtful if it is translated: we desire nothing except with a view to our\\nwell-\\nbeing\\nor\\nwoe\\n, whereas if it is rendered: we will nothing under the direction of\\nreason except insofar as we hold it to be good or evil, it is indubitably certain\\nand at the same time quite clearly expressed.\\nWell-being\\nor\\nill-being\\nalways signi\\nﬁ\\nes only a reference to our state of\\nagreeableness\\nor\\ndisagreeableness\\n, of grati\\nﬁ\\ncation or pain, and if we desire or\\navoid an object on this account we do so only insofar as it is referred to our\\nsensibility and to the feeling of pleasure or displeasure it causes. But\\ngood\\nor\\nevil\\nalways signi\\nﬁ\\nes a reference to the\\nwill\\ninsofar as it is determined by the\\nlaw\\nof reason\\nto make something its object; for, it is never determined directly by\\nthe object and the representation of it, but is instead a faculty of making a rule\\nof reason the motive of an action (by which an object can become real). Thus\\ngood or evil is, strictly speaking, referred to actions, not to the person\\n’\\ns state of\\nfeeling, and if anything is to be good or evil absolutely (and in every respect\\nand without any further condition), or is to be held to be such, it would be only\\nthe way of acting, the maxim of the will, and consequently the acting person\\nhimself as a good or evil human being, that could be so called, but not a thing.\\nThus one may always laugh at the Stoic who in the most intense pains of gout\\ncried out: Pain, however you torment me I will still never admit that you are\\nsomething evil (\\nκακον\\n,\\nmalum\\n)!; nevertheless, he was correct. He felt that the pain\\nwas an ill, and his cry betrayed that; but he had no cause whatever to grant that\\nany evil attached to him because of it, for the pain did not in the least diminish the\\nworth of his person but only the worth of his condition. A single lie of which he\\nhad been aware would have had to strike down his pride,\\nf\\nbut the pain served\\nonly as an occasion to raise it when he was aware that he had not incurred it by\\nany wrongful action and thereby made himself deserving of punishment.\\nWhat we are to call good must be an object of the faculty of desire in\\n5:61\\nthe\\njudgment of every reasonable human being, and evil an object of aversion in\\nthe eyes of everyone; hence for this appraisal reason is needed, in addition to\\nsense. So it is with truthfulness as opposed to lying, with justice as opposed to\\nviolence, and so forth. But we can call something an ill which everyone must\\nyet at the same time pronounce good, sometimes mediately but sometimes\\na\\ngood\\nb\\nwell-being\\nc\\nevil\\nd\\nill-being\\ne\\nwoe\\nf\\nMut\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n51even immediately.

The human being is a being with\\nneeds, insofar as he belongs to the sensible world, and to this extent his reason\\ncertainly has a commission from the side of his sensibility which it cannot\\nrefuse, to attend to its interest and to form practical maxims with a view to\\nhappiness in this life and, where possible, in a future life as well. But he is\\nnevertheless not so completely an animal as to be indifferent to all that reason\\nsays on its own and to use reason merely as a tool for the satisfaction of his\\nneeds as a sensible being. For, that he has reason does not at all raise him in\\nworth above mere animality if reason is to serve him only for the sake of what\\ninstinct accomplishes for animals; reason would in that case be only a partic-\\nular mode\\nh\\nnature had used to equip the human being for the same end to\\nwhich it has\\n5:62\\ndestined\\ni\\nanimals, without destining him to a higher end. No\\ndoubt once this arrangement of nature has been made for him he needs reason\\nin order to take into consideration at all times his well-being and woe; but\\nbesides this he has it for a higher purpose:\\nj\\nnamely, not only to re\\nﬂ\\nect upon\\nwhat is good or evil in itself as well\\n–\\nabout which only pure reason, not\\nsensibly interested at all, can judge\\n–\\nbut also to distinguish the latter appraisal\\naltogether from the former and to make it the supreme condition of the\\nformer.\\nIn this appraisal of what is good and evil in itself, as distinguished from\\nwhat can be called so only with reference to well-being or ill-being, it is a\\nquestion of the following points. Either a rational principle is already thought\\nas in itself the determining ground of the will without regard to possible\\nobjects of the faculty of desire (hence through the mere lawful form of the\\nmaxim), in which case that principle is a practical law a priori and pure reason\\ng\\ndas ihm Recht geschehe\\nh\\nManier\\ni\\nbestimmt hat\\nj\\nBehuf\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n52is taken to be practical of itself. In that case the law determines the will\\nimmediately\\n, the action in conformity with it is\\nin itself good\\n, and a will whose\\nmaxim always conforms with this law is\\ngood absolutely, good in every respect\\nand the\\nsupreme condition of all good\\n. Or else a determining ground of the\\nfaculty of desire precedes the maxim of the will, which presupposes an object\\nof pleasure or displeasure and hence something that\\ngrati\\nﬁ\\nes\\nor\\npains\\n, and the\\nmaxim of reason to pursue the former and avoid the latter determines actions\\nwhich are good with reference to our inclination and hence good only medi-\\nately (relatively to a further end, as means to it), and such maxims can in that\\ncase never be called laws but can still be called rational practical precepts. The\\nend itself, the grati\\nﬁ\\ncation that we seek, is in the latter case not a\\ngood\\nbut a\\nwell-being\\n, not a concept of reason but an empirical concept of an object of\\nfeeling; but the use of means to it, that is, the action, is nevertheless called good\\n(because rational re\\nﬂ\\nection is required for it), not, however, good absolutely\\nbut only with reference to our sensibility, with respect to its feeling of pleasure\\nand displeasure; but the will whose maxim is affected by it is not a pure will,\\nwhich is directed only to that by which pure reason can of itself be practical.\\nThis is the place to explain the paradox of method in a\\nCritique of\\n5:63\\nPractical\\nReason, namely, that the concept of good and evil must not be determined before the\\nmoral law (for which, as it would seem, this concept would have to be made the\\nbasis) but only (as was done here) after it and by means of it\\n. That is to say: even\\nif we did not know that the principle of morality is a pure law determining the\\nwill a priori, we would at least have to leave it\\nundecided\\nin the beginning\\nwhether the will has only empirical or also pure determining grounds a priori,\\nin order not to assume principles quite gratuitously (\\ngratis\\n); for, it is\\ncontrary to all basic rules of philosophic procedure to assume as already\\ndecided the foremost question to be decided. Suppose that we wanted to\\nbegin with the concept of the good in order to derive from it laws of the will:\\nthen this concept of an object (as a good object) would at the same time supply\\nthis as the sole determining ground of the will. Now, since this concept had no\\npractical a priori law for its standard, the criterion of good or evil could be\\nplaced in nothing other than the agreement of the object with our feeling of\\npleasure or displeasure, and the use of reason could only consist partly in\\ndetermining this pleasure or displeasure in connection with all the feelings of\\nmy existence and partly in determining the means for providing myself with\\nthe object of such feelings. Now, since what is in keeping with the feeling of\\npleasure can be made out only through experience, and since the practical law\\nis nevertheless, by hypothesis, to be based on this as its condition, the\\npossibility of a priori practical laws would be at once excluded, because it\\nwas thought to be necessary\\nﬁ\\nrst of all to\\nﬁ\\nnd an object for the will, the concept\\nof which, as that of a good, would have to constitute the universal though\\nempirical determining ground of the will. But what it was necessary to\\ninvestigate\\nﬁ\\nrst was whether there is not also an a priori determining ground\\nof the will (which could never be found elsewhere than in a pure practical law,\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n53and indeed insofar as it prescribes to maxims only their lawful form without\\nregard to an object). Since, however, an object in accordance with concepts of\\nthe good and evil had already been made the basis of all practical laws, while\\nthe former, without a law preceding it, could be thought only by empirical\\nconcepts, the possibility of even thinking of a pure practical law was already\\nremoved in advance; on the other hand, if the latter had\\nﬁ\\nrst been investigated\\n5:64\\nanalytically it would have been found that, instead of the concept of the good\\nas an object determining and making possible the moral law, it is on the\\ncontrary the moral law that\\nﬁ\\nrst determines and makes possible the concept\\nof the good, insofar as it deserves this name absolutely.\\nThis remark, which concerns only the method of ultimate moral inves-\\ntigations, is important. It explains at once the occasioning ground of all the\\nerrors of philosophers with respect to the supreme principle of morals. For\\nthey sought an object of the will in order to make it into the matter and the\\nground of a law (which was thus to be the determining ground of the will not\\nimmediately but rather by means of that object referred to the feeling of\\npleasure or displeasure), whereas they should\\nﬁ\\nrst have searched for a law\\nthat determined the will a priori and immediately, and only then determined\\nthe object conformable to the will. Now, whether they placed this object of\\npleasure, which was to yield the supreme concept of good, in happiness, in\\nperfection, in moral feeling, or in the will of God, their principle was in every\\ncase heteronomy and they had to come unavoidably upon empirical conditions\\nfor a moral law, since they could call their object, as the immediate determin-\\ning ground of the will, good or evil only by its immediate relation to feeling,\\nwhich is always empirical. Only a formal law, that is, one that prescribes to\\nreason nothing more than the form of its universal lawgiving as the supreme\\ncondition of maxims, can be a priori a determining ground of practical reason.\\nThe ancients revealed this error openly by directing their moral investigation\\nentirely to the determination of the concept of the\\nhighest good\\n, and so of an\\nobject which they intended afterwards to make the determining ground of the\\nwill in the moral law, an object which can much later\\n–\\nwhen the moral law has\\nﬁ\\nrst been established by itself and justi\\nﬁ\\ned as the immediate determining\\nground of the will\\n–\\nbe represented as object to the will, now determined a\\npriori in its form; and this we will undertake in the Dialectic of pure practical\\nreason. The moderns, with whom the question of the highest good seems to\\nhave gone out of use or at least to have become a secondary matter, hide the\\nabove error (as in many other cases) behind\\n5:65\\nindeterminate words; but one can\\nstill see it showing through their systems, since it always reveals heteronomy\\nof practical reason, from which an a priori moral law commanding universally\\ncan never arise.\\nNow, since the concepts of good and evil, as consequences of the a priori\\ndetermination of the will, presuppose also a pure practical principle and hence\\na causality of pure reason, they do not refer originally to objects (as, say,\\ndeterminations of the synthetic unity of the manifold of given intuitions in one\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n54consciousness), as do the pure concepts of the understanding or categories of\\nreason used theoretically; instead, they presuppose these objects as given; they\\nare rather, without exception,\\nmodi\\nof a single category, namely that of\\ncausality, insofar as the determining ground of causality consists in reason\\n’\\ns\\nrepresentation of a law of causality which, as the law of freedom, reason gives\\nto itself and thereby proves itself a priori to be practical. However, since\\nactions\\non the one side\\nindeed belong under a law which is no law of nature but a\\nlaw of freedom, and consequently belong to the conduct of intelligible\\nbeings, but\\non the other side\\nas also events in the sensible world yet belong to\\nappearances, the determinations of a practical reason can take place only with\\nreference to the latter and therefore, indeed, conformably with the categories\\nof the understanding, but not with a view to a theoretical use of the under-\\nstanding, in order to bring a priori the manifold of (sensible)\\nintuition\\nunder\\none consciousness, but only in order to subject a priori the manifold of\\ndesires\\nto the unity of consciousness of a practical reason commanding in the moral\\nlaw, or of a pure will.\\nThese\\ncategories of freedom\\n–\\nf o rt h i si sw h a tw ea r eg o i n gt oc a l lt h e mi n\\ncontrast to those theoretical concepts which are categories of nature\\n–\\nhave\\nan obvious advantage over the latter inasmuch as the latter are only forms of\\nthought which, by means of universal co\\nncepts, designate only indetermin-\\nately objects in general for every intuition possible for us; the former, on the\\ncontrary, are directed to the determination of a free choice\\nk\\n(to which indeed\\nno fully corresponding intuition can be given but which\\n–\\nas does not\\nhappen in the case of any concepts of th\\ne theoretical use of our cognitive\\nfaculty\\n–\\nh a sa si t sb a s i sap u r ep r a c t i c a ll a wap r i o r i ) ;h e n c e ,i n s t e a do ft h e\\nform of intuition (space and time), wh\\ni c hd o e sn o tl i ei nr e a s o ni t s e l fb u t\\nmust be drawn from elsewhere, namely from sensibility, these, as practical\\nelementary concepts, have as their basis the\\nform of a\\n5:66\\npure will\\nas given\\nwithin reason and therefore within the thinking faculty itself; by this it\\nhappens that, since all precepts of pure practical reason have to do only\\nwith the\\ndetermination of the will\\n, not with the natural conditions (of\\npractical ability) for\\ncarrying out its purpose\\n,t h ep r a c t i c a lap r i o r ic o n c e p t s\\nin relation to the supreme principle o\\nf freedom at once become cognitions\\nand do not have to wait for intuitions in order to receive meaning; and\\nthis happens for the noteworthy reas\\non that they themselves produce the\\nreality of that to which they refer (the disposition of the will), which is not\\nthe business of theoretical concepts. But one must note well that these\\ncategories concern only practical re\\nason in general and so proceed in their\\norder from those which are as yet morally undetermined and sensibly\\nconditioned to those which, being sens\\nibly unconditioned, are determined\\nonly by the moral law.\\nk\\nfreien Willkür\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n555:67\\nOne quickly sees that in this table freedom is regarded as a kind of\\ncausality\\n–\\nwhich, however, is not subject to empirical grounds of determi-\\nnation\\n–\\nwith respect to actions possible through it as appearances in the\\nsensible world, and that consequently it is referred to the categories of their\\nnatural possibility,\\nn\\nwhile yet each category is taken so universally that the\\ndetermining ground of that causality can be taken to be also outside the\\nsensible world in freedom as the property of an intelligible being, until\\nthe categories of modality introduce, but only\\nproblematically\\n, the transition\\nfrom practical principles in general to those of morality, which can only\\nafterwards be presented\\ndogmatically\\nthrough the moral law.\\nI add nothing further here to elucidate the present table, since it is\\nintelligible enough in itself.

In this way one surveys the whole plan of what\\nhas to be done, every question of practical philosophy that has to be answered,\\nand also the order that is to be followed.\\nOF THE TYPIC OF PURE PRACTICAL JUDGMENT\\np\\nThe concepts of good and evil\\nﬁ\\nrst determine an object for the will. They\\nthemselves, however, stand under a practical rule of reason which, if it is pure\\nreason, determines the will a priori with respect to its object. Now, whether an\\naction possible for us in sensibility is or is not a case that stands under the rule\\nrequires practical judgment, by which what is said in the rule universally (\\nin\\nabstracto\\n) is applied to an action\\nin concreto\\n. But a practical rule of pure reason\\nﬁ\\nrst\\n,a s\\npractical\\n, concerns the existence of an object, and\\nsecond\\n,a s\\na practical\\nrule\\nof pure reason, brings with it necessity with respect to the existence of an\\naction and is thus a practical law, not a natural law through empirical grounds\\nof determination but a law of\\n5:68\\nfreedom in accordance with which the will is to\\nbe determinable independently of anything empirical (merely through the\\nrepresentation of a law in general and its form); however, all cases of possible\\nactions that occur can be only empirical, that is, belong to experience and\\nnature; hence, it seems absurd to want to\\nﬁ\\nnd in the sensible world a case\\nwhich, though as such it stands only under the law of nature, yet admits of the\\napplication to it of a law of freedom and to which there could be applied\\nthe supersensible idea of the morally good, which is to be exhibited in it\\nin\\nconcreto\\n. Thus the judgment of pure practical reason is subject to the very\\nsame dif\\nﬁ\\nculties as that of pure theoretical reason, though the latter had means\\nat hand of escaping from these dif\\nﬁ\\nculties, namely that with respect to its\\ntheoretical use it depended upon intuitions to which pure concepts of the\\nunderstanding could be applied, and such intuitions (though only of objects of\\nthe senses) can be given a priori and thus, as far as the connection of the\\nmanifold in them is concerned, given a priori (as\\nschemata\\n) conformably with\\npure concepts of the understanding. On the other hand, the morally good as\\nan object is something supersensible, so that nothing corresponding to it can\\nbe found in any sensible intuition; and judgment under laws of pure practical\\nreason seems, therefore, to be subject to special dif\\nﬁ\\nculties having their source\\nin this: that a law of freedom is to be applied to actions as events that take place\\nin the sensible world and so, to this extent, belong to nature.\\nBut here again a favorable prospect opens for pure practical judgment.\\nSubsumption of an action possible to me in the sensible world under a\\npure\\npractical law\\ndoes not concern the possibility of the\\naction\\nas an event in the\\no\\nGattung\\np\\nUrteilskraft\\n, i.e.,\\n“\\nthe faculty of judgment\\n”\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n57sensible world; for, it belongs to the theoretical use of reason to appraise that\\npossibility in accordance with the law of causality, a pure concept of the\\nunderstanding for which reason has a\\nschema\\nin sensible intuition. Physical\\ncausality, or the condition under which it takes place, belongs among concepts\\nof nature, whose schema transcendental imagination sketches. Here, however,\\nwe have to do not with the schema of a case in accordance with laws but with\\nthe schema of a law itself (if the word schema is appropriate here), since the\\ndetermination of the will\\n(not the\\n5:69\\naction with reference to its result) through the\\nlaw alone without any other determining ground connects the concept of\\ncausality to conditions quite other than those which constitute natural\\nconnection.\\nTo a natural law, as a law to which objects of sensible intuition as such are\\nsubject, there must correspond a schema, that is, a universal procedure of the\\nimagination (by which it presents a priori to the senses the pure concept of the\\nunderstanding which the law determines). But no intuition can be put under\\nthe law of freedom (as that of a causality not sensibly conditioned)\\n–\\nand hence\\nunder the concept of the unconditioned good as well\\n–\\nand hence no schema\\non behalf of its application\\nin concreto\\n. Thus the moral law has no cognitive\\nfaculty other than the understanding (not the imagination) by means of which\\nit can be applied to objects of nature, and what the understanding can put\\nunder an idea of reason is not a\\nschema\\nof sensibility but a law, such a law,\\nhowever, as can be presented\\nin concreto\\nin objects of the senses and hence a\\nlaw of nature, though only as to its form; this law is what the understanding\\ncan put under an idea of reason on behalf of judgment, and we can, accord-\\ningly, call it the\\ntype\\nof the moral law.\\nThe rule of judgment under laws of pure practical reason is this: ask\\nyourself whether, if the action you propose were to take place by a law of\\nthe nature of which you were yourself a part, you could indeed regard it as\\npossible through your will. Everyone does, in fact, appraise actions as morally\\ngood or evil by this rule. Thus one says: if\\neveryone\\npermitted himself to\\ndeceive when he believed it to be to his advantage, or considered himself\\nauthorized to shorten his life as soon as he was thoroughly weary of it, or\\nlooked with complete indifference on the need of others, and if you belonged\\nto such an order of things, would you be in it with the assent of your will? Now\\neveryone knows very well that if he permits himself to deceive secretly it does\\nnot follow that everyone else does so, or that if, unobserved, he is hard-\\nhearted,\\nq\\neveryone would not straightaway be so toward him; accordingly,\\nthis comparison of the maxim of his actions with a universal law of nature is\\nalso not the determining ground of his will. Such a law is, nevertheless, a\\ntype\\nfor the appraisal of maxims in accordance with moral principles. If the maxim\\nof the action is not so constituted that it can stand the test as to the form of a\\nq\\nlieblos\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n58law of nature in\\n5:70\\ngeneral, then it is morally impossible. This is how even the\\nmost common understanding judges; for the law of nature always lies at the\\nbasis of its most ordinary judgments, even those of experience. Thus it has the\\nlaw of nature always at hand, only that in cases where causality from freedom is\\nto be appraised it makes that\\nlaw of nature\\nmerely the type of a\\nlaw of freedom\\n,\\nbecause without having at hand something which it could make an example in\\na case of experience, it could not provide use in application for the law of a\\npure practical reason.\\nHence it is also permitted to use\\nthe nature of the sensible world\\nas the\\ntype\\nof\\nan\\nintelligible nature\\n, provided that I do not carry over into the latter intuitions\\nand what depends upon them but refer to it only the\\nform of lawfulness\\nin\\ngeneral (the concept of which occurs even in the most common use of reason,\\nalthough it cannot be determinately cognized a priori for any purpose other\\nthan the pure practical use of reason). For to this extent laws as such are the\\nsame, no matter from what they derive their determining grounds.\\nFurthermore, since of all the intelligible absolutely nothing [is cognized]\\nexcept freedom (by means of the moral law), and even this only insofar as it is a\\npresupposition inseparable from that law; and since, moreover, all intelligible\\nobjects to which reason might lead us under the guidance of that law have in\\nturn no reality for us except on behalf of that law and of the use of pure\\npractical reason, although reason is entitled and even required to use nature\\n(in the understanding\\n’\\ns pure form of nature) as the\\ntype\\nof judgment; the\\npresent remark will serve to prevent reckoning among concepts themselves\\nthat which belongs only to the\\ntypic\\nof concepts. This, then, as the typic of\\njudgment, guards against\\nempiricism\\nof practical reason, which places the\\npractical concepts of good and evil merely in experiential consequences (so-\\ncalled happiness), although happiness and the endless useful consequences of\\na will determined by self-love, if this will at the same time made itself into a\\nuniversal law of nature, can certainly serve as a quite suitable type for the\\nmorally good but is still not identical with it. The same typic also guards\\nagainst\\nmysticism\\nof practical reason, which makes what served only as a\\nsymbol\\ninto a\\nschema\\n, that is, puts under the application\\n5:71\\nof moral concepts real but not\\nsensible intuitions (of an invisible kingdom of God) and strays into the tran-\\nscendent. Only\\nrationalism\\nof judgment is suitable for the use of moral\\nconcepts, since it takes from sensible nature nothing more than what pure\\nreason can also think for itself, that is, conformity with law, and transfers into\\nthe supersensible nothing but what can, conversely, be really exhibited by\\nactions in the sensible world in accordance with the formal rule of a law of\\nnature in general. However, it is much more important and advisable to guard\\nagainst\\nempiricism\\nof practical reason, since\\nmysticism\\nis still compatible with\\nthe purity and sublimity of the moral law and, besides, it is not natural and not\\nin keeping with the common way of thinking to strain one\\n’\\ns imagination to\\nsupersensible intuitions, so that the danger from this side is not so general;\\nempiricism, on the contrary, destroys at its roots the morality of dispositions\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n59(in which, and not merely in actions, consists the high worth that humanity\\ncan and ought to procure for itself through morality), and substitutes for it\\nsomething quite different, namely in place of duty an empirical interest, with\\nwhich the inclinations generally are secretiy leagued; and empiricism, more-\\nover, being on this account allied with all the inclinations, which (no matter\\nwhat fashion they put on) degrade humanity when they are raised to the\\ndignity of a supreme practical principle and which are, nevertheless, so\\nfavorable to everyone\\n’\\ns way of feeling,\\nr\\nis for that reason much more danger-\\nous than any enthusiasm, which can never constitute a lasting condition of any\\ngreat number of people\\ns\\nChapter III\\nOn the incentives of pure practical reason\\nWhat is essential to any moral worth of actions is\\nthat the moral law determine\\nthe will immediately\\n. If the determination of the will takes place\\nconformably\\nwith the moral law but only by means of a feeling, of whatever kind, that has to\\nbe presupposed in order for the law to become a suf\\nﬁ\\ncient determining\\nground of the will, so that the action is not done\\nfor the sake of the law\\n, then\\nthe action will contain\\nlegality\\nindeed but not\\nmorality\\n.\\n5:72\\nNow, if by\\nincentive\\n(\\nelater animi\\n) is understood the subjective determining ground of the will of a\\nbeing whose reason does not by its nature necessarily conform with the\\nobjective law, then it will follow:\\nﬁ\\nrst that no incentives at all can be attributed\\nto the divine will, but that the incentive of the human will (and of the will of\\nevery created rational being) can never be anything other than the moral law,\\nand hence that the objective determining ground must always and quite alone\\nbe also the subjectively suf\\nﬁ\\ncient determining ground of action, if this is not\\nmerely to ful\\nﬁ\\nll the\\nletter\\nof the law without containing its\\nspirit\\n.*\\nFor the sake of the law and in order to give it in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the will one must\\nnot, then, look for some other incentive by which that of the moral law itself\\nmight be dispensed with, because this would produce sheer hypocrisy without\\nsubstance,\\nt\\nand it is even hazardous to let any other incentive (such as that of\\nadvantage) so much as cooperate\\nalongside\\nthe moral law; so nothing further\\nremains than to determine carefully in what way the moral law becomes the\\nincentive and, inasmuch as it is, what happens to the human faculty of desire\\nas an effect of that determining ground upon it. For, how a law can be of itself\\nan immediately a determining ground of the will (though this is what is\\nr\\nSinnesart\\ns\\nThe construction of the last part of this sentence is, as Natorp remarks,\\n“\\ndif\\nﬁ\\ncult, but with Kant\\nperhaps still possible.\\n”\\nWith minor changes I have reproduced Abbott\\n’\\ns construction.\\nt\\nohne Bestand\\n* Of every action that conforms to the law but is not done for the sake of the law, one can say that it\\nis morally good only in accordance with the\\nletter\\nbut not the\\nspirit\\n(the disposition).\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n60essential in all morality) is for human reason an insoluble problem and\\nidentical with that of how a free will is possible. What we shall have to show\\na priori is, therefore, not the ground from which\\nu\\nthe moral law in itself\\nsupplies an incentive but rather what it effects (or, to put it better, must effect)\\nin the mind insofar as it is an incentive.\\nWhat is essential in every determination of the will by the moral law is that,\\nas a free will\\n–\\nand so not only without the cooperation of sensible impulses but\\neven with rejection of all of them and with infringement upon all inclinations\\ninsofar as they could be opposed to that law\\n–\\nit is determined solely by the\\nlaw. So far, then, the effect of the moral law as incentive is only negative, and\\nas such this incentive can be cognized a priori. For, all inclination and every\\nsensible impulse is based on feeling, and the negative effect on feeling (by the\\ninfringement upon the\\n5:73\\ninclinations that takes place) is itself feeling. Hence we\\ncan see a priori that the moral law, as the determining ground of the will, must\\nby thwarting all our inclinations produce a feeling that can be called pain; and\\nhere we have the\\nﬁ\\nrst and perhaps the only case in which we can determine a\\npriori from concepts the relation of a cognition (here the cognition of a pure\\npractical reason) to the feeling of pleasure or displeasure. All the inclinations\\ntogether (which can be brought into a tolerable system and the satisfaction of\\nwhich is then called one\\n’\\ns own happiness) constitute regard for oneself\\nv\\n(\\nsolipsismus\\n). This is either the self-regard of\\nlove for oneself\\n, a predominant\\nbenevolence\\ntoward oneself (\\nPhilautia\\n), or that of\\nsatisfaction with oneself\\n(\\nArrogantia\\n). The former is called, in particular,\\nself-love\\n;\\nw\\nthe latter,\\nself-\\nconceit\\n.\\nx\\nPure practical reason merely\\ninfringes upon\\nself-love, inasmuch as it\\nonly restricts it, as natural and active in us even prior to the moral law, to the\\ncondition of agreement with this law, and then it is called\\nrational self-love\\n. But\\nit\\nstrikes down\\nself-conceit altogether, since all claims to esteem for oneself that\\nprecede accord with the moral law are null and quite unwarranted because\\ncertainty of a disposition in accord with this law is the\\nﬁ\\nrst condition of any\\nworth of a person (we shall soon make this more distinct), and any presump-\\ntion prior to this is false and opposed to the law. Now, the propensity to self-\\nesteem, so long as it rests only on sensibility, belongs with the inclinations\\nwhich the moral law infringes upon. So the moral law strikes down self-\\nconceit. But since this law is still something in itself positive\\n–\\nnamely the\\nform of an intellectual causality, that is, of freedom\\n–\\nit is at the same time an\\nobject of\\nrespect\\ninasmuch as, in opposition to its subjective antagonist, namely\\nthe inclinations in us, it\\nweakens\\nself-conceit; and inasmuch as it even\\nstrikes down\\nself-conceit, that is, humiliates it, it is an object of the greatest\\nrespect\\nand so too the ground of a positive feeling that is not of empirical origin\\nu\\nwoher\\nv\\nSelbstsucht\\nw\\nEigenliebe\\nx\\nEigendünkel\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n61and is cognized a priori. Consequently, respect for the moral law is a feeling\\nthat is produced by an intellectual ground, and this feeling is the only one that\\nwe can cognize completely a priori and the necessity of which we can have\\ninsight into.\\n5:74\\nIn the preceding chapter we have seen that anything which presents\\nitself as an object of the will\\nprior to\\nthe moral law is excluded from the\\ndetermining grounds of the will called the unconditionally good by that law\\nitself as the supreme condition of practical reason, and that the mere\\npractical form, which consists in the\\nﬁ\\ntness of maxims for giving universal\\nlaw,\\nﬁ\\nrst determines what is good in its\\nelf and absolutely and grounds the\\nmaxims of a pure will, which alone is good in every respect. Now, however,\\nwe\\nﬁ\\nnd our nature as sensible beings so constituted that the matter of the\\nfaculty of desire (objects of incli\\nnation, whether of hope or fear)\\nﬁ\\nrst forces\\nitself upon us, and we\\nﬁ\\nnd our pathologically determinable self, even though\\nit is quite un\\nﬁ\\nt to give universal law through its maxims, nevertheless\\nstriving antecedently to make its claims primary and originally valid, just\\nas if it constituted our entire self. Thi\\ns propensity to make oneself as having\\nsubjective determining grounds of choice\\ny\\ninto the objective determining\\nground of the will in general can be called\\nself-love\\n; and if self-love makes\\nitself lawgiving and the unconditional\\npractical principle, it can be called\\nself-conceit\\n. Now the moral law, which alone is truly objective (namely\\nobjective in every respect)\\n, excludes altogether the in\\nﬂ\\nuence of self-love\\non the supreme practical principle and infringes without end upon self-\\nconceit, which prescribes as laws the\\nsubjective conditions of self-love.\\nNow, what in our own judgment infrin\\nges upon our self-conceit humiliates.\\nHence the moral law unavoidably humiliates every human being when he\\ncompares with it the sensible propens\\nity of his nature. If something repre-\\nsented\\nas a determining ground of our will\\nhumiliates us in our self-\\nconsciousness, it awakens\\nrespect\\nfor itself insofar as it is positive and a\\ndetermining ground. Therefore the moral law is even subjectively a ground\\nof respect. Now, all that is found in self\\n-love belongs to inclination, while all\\ninclination rests on feeling, so that what\\ninfringes upon all the inclinations in\\nself-love has, just by this, a necessary in\\nﬂ\\nuence on feeling; thus we conceive\\nhow it is possible to see a priori that the moral law can exercise an effect on\\nfeeling, inasmuch as it excludes the inclinations and the propensity to make\\nthem the supreme practical condition, t\\nhat is, self-love, from all participa-\\ntion in the supreme lawgiving\\n–\\nan effect which on the one side is merely\\nnegative\\nbut on the other side, and indeed wi\\nth respect to the restricting\\n5:75\\nground of pure practical reason, is\\npositive\\n; and for this no special kind of\\nfeeling need be assumed, under the name of a practical or moral feeling\\npreceding the moral law and serving as its basis.\\ny\\nsich selbst nach den subjectiven Bestimmungsgründen seiner Willkür\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n62The negative effect upon feeling (disagreeableness) is\\npathological\\n,a si s\\nevery in\\nﬂ\\nuence on feeling and every feeling in general. As the effect of\\nconsciousness of the moral law, and consequently in relation to an intelligible\\ncause, namely the subject of pure practical reason as the supreme lawgiver,\\nthis feeling of a rational subject affected by inclinations is indeed called\\nhumiliation (intellectual contempt); but in relation to its positive ground,\\nthe law, it is at the same time called respect for the law; there is indeed no\\nfeeling for this law, but inasmuch as it moves resistance out of the way, in the\\njudgment of reason this removal of a hindrance is esteemed equivalent to a\\npositive furthering of its causality. Because of this, this feeling can now also be\\ncalled a feeling of respect for the moral law, while on both grounds together it\\ncan be called a\\nmoral feeling\\n.\\nThus the moral law, since it is a formal determining ground of action\\nthrough practical pure reason and since it is also a material but only objective\\ndetermining ground of the objects of action under the name of good and evil,\\nis also a subjective determining ground\\n–\\nthat is, an incentive\\n–\\nto this action\\ninasmuch as it has in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the sensibility of the subject and effects a\\nfeeling conducive to the in\\nﬂ\\nuence of the law upon the will. There is here no\\nantecedent\\nfeeling in the subject that would be attuned to morality: that is\\nimpossible, since all feeling is sensible whereas the incentive of the moral\\ndisposition must be free from any sensible condition. Instead, sensible feeling,\\nwhich underlies all our inclinations, is indeed the condition of that feeling we\\ncall respect, but the cause determining it lies in pure practical reason; and so\\nthis feeling, on account of its origin, cannot be called pathologically effected\\nbut must be called\\npractically effected\\n, and is effected as follows: the repre-\\nsentation of the moral law deprives self-love of its in\\nﬂ\\nuence and self-conceit of\\nits illusion, and thereby the hindrance to pure practical reason is lessened and\\nthe representation of the superiority of its objective law to the\\n5:76\\nimpulses of\\nsensibility, and with it the relative weightiness of the law (with regard to a will\\naffected by impulses), is produced in the judgment of reason through the\\nremoval of the counterweight. And so respect for the law is not the incentive to\\nmorality; instead it is morality itself subjectively considered as an incentive\\ninasmuch as pure practical reason, by rejecting all the claims of self-love in\\nopposition with its own, supplies authority to the law, which now alone has\\nin\\nﬂ\\nuence. With regard to this it should be noted that, since respect is an effect\\non feeling and hence on the sensibility of a rational being, it presupposes this\\nsensibility and so too the\\nﬁ\\nnitude of such beings on whom the moral law\\nimposes respect, and that respect for the\\nlaw\\ncannot be attributed to a supreme\\nbeing or even to one free from all sensibility, in whom this cannot be an\\nobstacle to practical reason.\\nThis feeling (under the name of moral feeling) is therefore produced solely\\nby reason. It does not serve for appraising actions and certainly not for\\ngrounding the objective moral law itself, but only as an incentive to make\\nthis law its maxim. But what name could one more suitably apply to this\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n63singular feeling which cannot be compared to any pathological feeling? It is of\\nsuch a peculiar kind that it seems to be at the disposal\\nz\\nonly of reason, and\\nindeed of practical pure reason.\\nRespect\\nis always directed only to persons, never to things. The latter can\\nawaken in us\\ninclination\\nand even\\nlove\\nif they are animals (e.g., horses, dogs,\\nand so forth), or also\\nfear\\n, like the sea, a volcano, a beast of prey, but never\\nrespect\\n. Something that comes nearer to this feeling is\\nadmiration\\n, and this as an\\naffect, amazement, can be directed to things also, for example, lofty moun-\\ntains, the magnitude, number, and distance of the heavenly bodies, the\\nstrength and swiftness of many animals, and so forth. But none of this is\\nrespect. A human being can also be an object of my love, fear, or admiration\\neven to amazement and yet not be an object of respect. His jocular humor, his\\ncourage and strength, the power he has by his rank among others, could\\ninspire me with feelings of this kind even though inner respect toward him is\\nlacking. Fontenelle\\n9\\nsays,\\n“\\nI bow before an eminent man, but my spirit does not\\nbow\\n.\\n”\\nI can add: before a humble\\n5:77\\ncommon man\\na\\nin whom I perceive upright-\\nness of character in a higher degree than I am aware of in myself\\nmy spirit bows\\n,\\nwhether I want it or whether I do not and hold my head ever so high, that he\\nmay not overlook my superior position. Why is this? His example holds before\\nme a law that strikes down my self-conceit when I compare it with my\\nconduct, and I see observance of that law and hence its\\npracticability\\nproved\\nbefore me in fact. Now, I may even be aware of a like degree of uprightness in\\nmyself, and yet the respect remains. For, since in human beings all good is\\ndefective, the law made intuitive by an example still strikes down my pride, the\\nstandard being furnished by the man I see before me whose impurity\\nb\\nsuch as\\nit may be, is not so well known to me as is my own who therefore appears to me\\nin a purer light.\\nRespect\\nis a\\ntribute\\nthat we cannot refuse to pay to merit,\\nwhether we want to or not; we may indeed withhold it outwardly but we still\\ncannot help feeling it inwardly.\\nSo little\\nis respect a feeling of\\npleasure\\nthat we give way to it only reluctantly\\nwith regard to a human being. We try to discover something that could lighten\\nthe burden of it for us, some fault in him to compensate us for the humiliation\\nthat comes upon us through such an example. Even the dead are not always\\nsafe from this critical examination, especially if their example appears inimit-\\nable. Even the moral law itself in its\\nsolemn majesty\\nis exposed to this striving to\\nresist respect for it. Can it be thought that any other cause can be assigned for\\nour being so ready to demean it to our familiar inclination, or that there is any\\nother cause of our taking such trouble to make it out to be the popular precept\\nof our own advantage well understood, than that we want to be free from the\\nz\\nzu Gebote\\na\\nniedrigen, bürgerlich gemeinen Mann\\nb\\nUnlauterkeit\\n. See\\nReligion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n29\\n–\\n30\\n). Later in the sentence\\n“\\npurer\\n”\\nis used to translate\\nreinerem\\n.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n64intimidating respect that shows us our own unworthiness with such severity?\\nBut, in turn,\\nso little displeasure\\nis there in it that, once one has laid self-conceit\\naside and allowed practical in\\nﬂ\\nuence to that respect, one can in turn never get\\nenough of contemplating the majesty of this law, and the soul believes itself\\nelevated in proportion as it sees the holy law elevated above itself and its frail\\nnature. No doubt, great talents and activity proportioned to them can\\n5:78\\nalso\\nproduce respect or a feeling analogous to it, and it is also quite proper to offer\\nit; and then it seems as if admiration were the same as that feeling. But if one\\nlooks more closely one will notice that, since it always remains uncertain how\\nmuch was contributed to someone\\n’\\ns competence by native talent and how\\nmuch by his industry in cultivating it, reason represents it to us as presumably\\nthe fruit of cultivation and so as merit, and this noticeably reduces our self-\\nconceit and either casts a reproach on us or imposes on us the following of\\nsuch an example in the way suitable to us. This respect, then, which we show\\nto such a person (strictly speaking to the law that his example holds before us)\\nis not mere admiration, as is also con\\nﬁ\\nrmed by this: that when the common run\\nof admirers believes it has somehow learned the badness of character of such a\\nman (such as Voltaire) it gives up all respect for him, whereas the true scholar\\nstill feels it at least with regard to his talents, because he is himself engaged in a\\nbusiness and a calling that make imitation of such a man to some extent a law\\nfor him.\\nRespect for the moral law is therefore the sole and also the undoubted\\nmoral incentive, and this feeling is also directed to no object except on this\\nbasis. First, the moral law determines the will objectively and immediately in\\nthe judgment of reason; but freedom, the causality of which is determinable\\nonly through the law, consists just in this: that it restricts all inclinations, and\\nconsequently the esteem of the person himself, to the condition of compliance\\nwith its pure law. This restriction now has an effect on feeling and produces\\nthe feeling of displeasure which can be cognized a priori from the moral law. It\\nis, however, so far a\\nnegative\\neffect which, as arising from the in\\nﬂ\\nuence of a\\npure practical reason, mainly infringes upon the activity of the subject so far as\\ninclinations are his determining grounds and hence upon the opinion of his\\npersonal worth (which, in the absence of agreement with the moral law, is\\nreduced to nothing), so that the effect of this law on feeling is merely\\nhumiliation, which we can thus discern a priori though we cannot cognize in\\nit the force of the pure practical law as incentive but only the resistance to\\nincentives of\\n5:79\\nsensibility. But the same law is yet objectively\\n–\\nthat is, in the\\nrepresentation of pure reason\\n–\\nan immediate determining ground of the will,\\nso that this humiliation takes place only relatively to the purity of the law;\\naccordingly, the lowering of pretensions to moral self-esteem\\n–\\nthat is,\\nhumiliation on the sensible side\\n–\\nis an elevation of the moral\\n–\\nthat is,\\npractical\\n–\\nesteem for the law itself on the intellectual side; in a word, it is\\nrespect for the law, and so also a feeling that is positive in its intellectual cause,\\nwhich is known a priori. For, whatever diminishes the hindrances to an\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n65activity is a furthering of this activity itself. Recognition of the moral law is,\\nhowever, consciousness of an activity of practical reason from objective\\ngrounds, which fails to express its effect in actions only because subjective\\n(pathological) causes hinder it. Therefore respect for the moral law must be\\nregarded as also a positive though indirect effect of the moral law on feeling\\ninsofar as the law weakens the hindering in\\nﬂ\\nuence of the inclinations by\\nhumiliating self-conceit, and must therefore be regarded as a subjective\\nground of activity\\n–\\nthat is, as the incentive to compliance with the law\\n–\\nand as the ground for maxims of a course of life in conformity with it. From\\nthe concept of an incentive arises that of an\\ninterest\\n, which can never be\\nattributed to any being unless it has reason and which signi\\nﬁ\\nes an\\nincentive\\nof the will insofar as it is\\nrepresented by reason\\n. Since in a morally good will the\\nlaw itself must be the incentive, the\\nmoral interest\\nis a pure sense-free interest\\nof practical reason alone. On the concept of an interest is based that of a\\nmaxim\\n.\\nA maxim is therefore morally genuine only if it rests solely on the interest one\\ntakes in compliance with the law. All three concepts, however\\n–\\nthat of an\\nincentive\\n,o fa n\\ninterest\\nand of a\\nmaxim\\n–\\ncan be applied only to\\nﬁ\\nnite beings.\\nFor they all presuppose a limitation of the nature of a being, in that the\\nsubjective constitution of its choice does not of itself accord with the objective\\nlaw of a practical reason; they presuppose a need to be impelled to activity by\\nsomething because an internal obstacle is opposed to it. Thus they cannot be\\napplied to the divine will.\\nThere is something so singular in the boundless esteem for the pure moral\\nlaw stripped of all advantage\\n–\\nas practical reason, whose voice makes even the\\nboldest evildoer tremble and forces him to hide from its\\n5:80\\nsight, presents it to us\\nfor obedience\\n–\\nthat one cannot wonder at\\nﬁ\\nnding this in\\nﬂ\\nuence of a mere\\nintellectual idea on feeling quite impenetrable for speculative reason and at\\nhaving to be satis\\nﬁ\\ned that one can yet see a priori this much: that such a feeling\\nis inseparably connected with the representation of the moral law in every\\nﬁ\\nnite rational being. If this feeling of respect were pathological and hence a\\nfeeling of\\npleasure\\nbased on the inner\\nsense\\n, it would be futile to [try to]\\ndiscover a priori a connection of it with any idea. But it is a feeling which is\\ndirected only to the practical and which depends on the representation of a law\\nonly as to its form and not on account of any object of the law; thus it cannot be\\nreckoned either as enjoyment or as pain, and yet it produces an\\ninterest\\nin\\ncompliance with the law which we call\\nmoral\\ninterest, just as the capacity to\\ntake such an interest in the law (or respect for the moral law itself) is\\nthe moral\\nfeeling\\nproperly speaking.\\nThe consciousness of a\\nfree\\nsubmission of the will to the law, yet as\\ncombined with an unavoidable constraint put on all inclinations though only\\nby one\\n’\\ns own reason, is respect for the law. The law that demands this respect\\nand also inspires it is, as one sees, none other than the moral law (for no other\\nexcludes all inclinations from immediate in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the will). An action that\\nis objectively practical in accordance with this law, with the exclusion of every\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n66determining ground of inclination, is called\\nduty\\n, which, because of that\\nexclusion, contains in its concept practical\\nnecessitation\\n, that is, determination\\nto actions however\\nreluctantly\\nthey may be done. The feeling that arises from\\nconsciousness of this necessitation is not pathological, as would be a feeling\\nproduced by an object of the senses, but practical only, that is, possible\\nthrough a preceding (objective) determination of the will and causality of\\nreason. As\\nsubmission\\nto a law, that is, as a command (indicating constraint for\\nthe sensibly affected subject), it therefore contains in it no pleasure but\\ninstead, so far, displeasure in the action. On the other hand, however, since\\nthis constraint is exercised only by the lawgiving of his\\nown\\nreason, it also\\ncontains something\\nelevating\\n, and the subjective effect on feeling, inasmuch as\\npure\\n5:81\\npractical reason is the sole cause of it\\nc\\ncan thus be called\\nself-approbation\\nwith reference to pure practical reason, inasmuch as he cognized himself as\\ndetermined to it solely by the law and without any interest, and now becomes\\nconscious of an altogether different interest subjectively produced by the law,\\nwhich is purely practical and\\nfree\\n; and his taking this interest in a dutiful action\\nis not advised by any inclination; instead, reason through the practical law\\nabsolutely commands it and also actually produces it, because of which it has a\\nquite special name, that of respect.\\nThe concept of duty, therefore, requires of the action\\nobjective\\naccord with\\nthe law but requires of the maxim of the action\\nsubjective\\nrespect for the law, as\\nthe sole way of determining the will by the law. And on this rests the\\ndistinction between consciousness of having acted\\nin conformity with duty\\nand\\nfrom duty\\n, that is, respect for the law, the\\nﬁ\\nrst of which (legality) is\\npossible even if the inclinations alone have been the determining grounds of\\nthe will whereas the second (\\nmorality\\n), moral worth, must be placed solely in\\nthis: that the action takes place from duty, that is, for the sake of the law alone.*\\nIt is of the greatest importance in all moral appraisals to attend with the\\nutmost exactness to the subjective principle of all maxims, so that all the\\nmorality of actions is placed in their necessity\\nfrom duty\\nand from respect for\\nthe law, not from love and liking\\nd\\nfor what the actions are to produce. For\\nhuman beings and all created rational beings moral necessity is necessitation,\\nthat is, obligation, and every action based on it is to be represented as duty, not\\nas a kind of conduct which we already favor of our own accord or could come\\nto favor\\n–\\nas if we could ever bring it about that\\n5:82\\nwithout respect for the law,\\nwhich is connected with fear or at least apprehension of transgressing it, we of\\nc\\nder letzteren\\n.\\n“\\nSomething elevating\\n”\\n(literally,\\n“\\nelevation\\n”\\n) is grammatically possible.\\nd\\nZuneigung\\n* If one examines accurately the concept of respect for persons, as it has already been set forth,\\none becomes aware that it always rests on consciousness of a duty which an example holds before\\nus, and that, accordingly, respect can never have any but a moral ground; and it is very good and\\neven, from a psychological point of view, very useful for knowledge of human beings that\\nwhenever we use this expression we should attend to the hidden and wonderful, yet often\\nrecurring, regard which the human being in his appraisals has for the moral law.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n67ourselves, like the Deity raised beyond all dependence, could come into\\npossession of\\nholiness\\nof will by an accord of will with the pure moral law\\nbecoming, as it were, our nature, an accord never to be disturbed (in which\\ncase the law would\\nﬁ\\nnally cease to be a command for us, since we could never\\nbe tempted to be unfaithful to it).\\nThe moral law is, in other words, for the will of a perfect being a law of\\nholiness\\n, but for the will of every\\nﬁ\\nnite rational being a law of\\nduty\\n, of moral\\nnecessitation and of the determination of his actions through\\nrespect\\nfor this\\nlaw and\\nreverence\\ne\\nfor his duty. No other subjective principle must be assumed\\nas incentive, for then the action can indeed turn out as the law prescribes, but\\nsince, though in conformity with duty it was not done from duty, the\\ndisposition to the action is not moral; and in this lawgiving it is really the\\ndisposition that matters.\\nIt is very beautiful to do good to human beings from love for them and from\\nsympathetic benevolence, or to be just from love of order; but this is not yet\\nthe genuine moral maxim of our conduct, the maxim be\\nﬁ\\ntting our position\\namong rational beings as\\nhuman beings\\n, when we presume with proud conceit,\\nlike volunteers, not to trouble ourselves about the thought of duty and, as\\nindependent of command, to want to do of our own pleasure what we think we\\nneed no command to do. We stand under a\\ndiscipline\\nof reason, and in all our\\nmaxims must not forget our subjection to it or withdraw anything from it or by\\nan egotistical illusion detract anything from the authority of the law (although\\nour own reason gives it), so as to put the determining ground of our will, even\\nthough it conforms with the law, anywhere else than in the law itself and in\\nrespect for this law. Duty and what is owed\\nf\\nare the only names that we must\\ngive to our relation to the moral law. We are indeed lawgiving members of a\\nkingdom of morals possible through freedom and represented to us by\\npractical reason for our respect; but we are at the same time subjects in it,\\nnot its sovereign, and to fail to recognize our inferior position as creatures and\\nto deny from self-conceit the authority of the holy law is already to defect\\n5:83\\nfrom it in spirit, even though the letter of the law is ful\\nﬁ\\nlled.\\nThe possibility of such a commandment\\ng\\nas\\nLove God above all, and your\\nneighbor as yourself\\nagrees with this very well.* For, as a commandment it\\nrequires respect for a law that\\ncommands\\nh\\nlove\\nand does not leave it to one\\n’\\ns\\ndiscretionary choice to make this one\\n’\\ns principle. But love for God as incli-\\nnation (pathological love) is impossible, for he is not an object of the senses.\\nThe same thing toward human beings is indeed possible but cannot be\\ne\\nEhrfurcht\\nf\\nSchuldigkeit\\ng\\nGebots\\nh\\nbe\\nﬁ\\nehlt\\n* The principle of one\\n’\\ns own happiness, which some would make the supreme principle of\\nmorality, is in striking contrast to this law. The former would go as follows:\\nLove yourself above all,\\nbut God and your neighbor for your own sake\\n.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n68commanded, for it is not within the power of any human being to love\\nsomeone merely on command.\\ni\\nIt is, therefore, only\\npractical love\\nthat is\\nunderstood in that kernel of all laws. To love God means, in this sense, to\\ndo what He commands\\ngladly\\n; to love one\\n’\\ns neighbor means to practice all\\nduties toward him\\ngladly\\n. But the command that makes this a rule cannot\\ncommand us to\\nhave\\nthis disposition in dutiful actions but only to\\nstrive\\nfor it.\\nFor, a command that one should do something gladly is in itself contradictory\\nbecause if we already know of ourselves what it is incumbent upon us to do\\nand, moreover, were conscious of liking to do it, a command about it would be\\nquite unnecessary; and if we did it without liking to do it but only from respect\\nfor the law, a command that makes this respect the incentive of our maxim\\nwould directly counteract the disposition commanded. That law of all laws,\\ntherefore, like all the moral precepts of the Gospel, presents the moral\\ndisposition in its complete perfection, in such a way that as an ideal of holiness\\nit is not attainable by any creature but is yet the archetype which we should\\nstrive to approach and resemble in an uninterrupted but endless progress.\\nThat is to say, if a rational creature could ever reach the stage of thoroughly\\nliking\\nto ful\\nﬁ\\nll all moral laws, this would mean that there would not be in him\\neven the possibility of a desire that would provoke him to deviate from them;\\nfor, to overcome such a desire always costs the subject some sacri\\nﬁ\\nce and\\ntherefore requires self-constraint, that is, inner necessitation to what one does\\n5:84\\nnot altogether like to do. But no creature can ever reach this stage of moral\\ndisposition. For, being a creature and thus always dependent with regard to\\nwhat he requires for complete satisfaction with his condition, he can never be\\naltogether free from desires and inclinations which, because they rest on\\nphysical causes, do not of themselves accord with the moral law, which has\\nquite different sources; and consequently, with reference to those desires, it is\\nalways necessary for him to base the disposition of his maxims on moral\\nnecessitation, not on ready\\nﬁ\\ndelity but on respect, which\\ndemands\\ncompliance\\nwith the law even though this is done reluctantly; not on love, which is not\\nanxious about any inner refusal of the will toward the law, even though it is\\nnecessary for him to make this latter\\n–\\nnamely, mere love for the law (which\\nwould then cease to be a\\ncommand\\n, and morality, having passed subjectively\\ninto holiness, would cease to be\\nvirtue\\n)\\n–\\nthe constant though unattainable goal\\nof his striving. For, in the case of what we highly esteem but yet dread\\n(because of consciousness of our weakness), through increased facility in\\nsatisfying it the most reverential dread changes into liking and respect into\\nlove; at least this would be the consummate perfection of a disposition devoted\\nto the law, if it were possible for a creature to attain it.\\nThis consideration is intended not so much to bring to clear concepts the\\nevangelical command just cited, in order to prevent\\nreligious enthusiasm\\nin\\ni\\nauf Befehl\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n69regard to love of God, but to determine accurately the moral disposition\\ndirectly, in regard to our duties toward human beings as well, and to check,\\nor where possible prevent, a\\nmerely moral\\nenthusiasm which infects many\\npeople. The moral level on which a human being (and, as far as we can see,\\nevery rational creature as well) stands is respect for the moral law. The\\ndisposition incumbent upon him to have in observing it is to do so from\\nduty, not from voluntary liking nor even from an endeavor he undertakes\\nunbidden, gladly and of his own accord; and his proper moral condition, in\\nwhich he can always be, is\\nvirtue\\n, that is, moral disposition\\nin con\\nﬂ\\nict\\n, and not\\nholiness\\nin the supposed\\npossession\\nof a complete\\npurity\\nof dispositions of the\\nwill. By exhortation to actions as noble, sublime, and magnanimous, minds are\\nattuned to nothing but moral enthusiasm and exaggerated self-conceit; by\\nsuch exhortations they are led into the\\n5:85\\ndelusion that it is not duty\\n–\\nthat is,\\nrespect for the law whose yoke (though it is a mild one because reason itself\\nimposes it on us) they must bear, even if reluctantly\\n–\\nwhich constitutes the\\ndetermining ground of their actions, and which always humbles them inas-\\nmuch as they observe the law (\\nobey\\nit), but that it is as if those actions are\\nexpected from them, not from duty but as bare merit. For, when they imitate\\nsuch deeds\\n–\\nnamely, from such a principle\\n–\\nnot only have they quite failed to\\nful\\nﬁ\\nll the spirit of the law, which consists in the disposition subjecting itself to\\nthe law, not in the lawfulness of the action (whatever the principle may be); not\\nonly do they locate the incentive\\npathologically\\n(in sympathy or self-love), not\\nmorally\\n(in the law); but they produce in this way a frivolous, high-\\nﬂ\\nown,\\nfantastic cast of mind,\\nﬂ\\nattering themselves with a spontaneous goodness of\\nheart\\nj\\nthat needs neither spur nor bridle and for which not even a command is\\nnecessary and thereby forgetting their obligation,\\nk\\nwhich they ought to think\\nof rather than merit. Actions of others that are done with great sacri\\nﬁ\\nce and for\\nthe sake of duty alone may indeed be praised by calling them\\nnoble\\nand\\nsublime\\ndeeds, but only insofar as there are traces suggesting that they were done\\nwholly from respect for duty and not from ebullitions of feeling. But if one\\nwants to represent these to someone as examples to be imitated, respect for\\nduty (which is the only genuine moral feeling) must be used as the incentive\\n–\\nthis earnest, holy precept that does not leave it to our vain self-love to dally\\nwith pathological impulses (as far as they are analogous to morality) and to\\ncredit ourselves with\\nmeritorious\\nworth. If only we search carefully we shall\\nﬁ\\nnd for all actions that are praiseworthy a law of duty, which\\ncommands\\nand\\ndoes not leave it to our discretion to choose what may be agreeable to our\\npropensity. This is the only way of representing them that educates the soul\\nmorally, because it alone is capable of\\nﬁ\\nrm and accurately determined\\nprinciples.\\nj\\nfreiwillige Gutartigkeit ihrer Gemüts\\nk\\nSchuldigkeit\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n70If\\nenthusiasm\\nin the most general sense is an overstepping of the bounds of\\nhuman reason undertaken on principles, then\\nmoral enthusiasm\\nis such an\\noverstepping of the bounds that practical pure reason sets to humanity,\\nthereby forbidding us to place the subjective determining ground of dutiful\\n5:86\\nactions\\n–\\nthat is, their moral motive\\n–\\nanywhere else than in the law itself or to\\nplace the disposition which is thereby brought into the maxims anywhere else\\nthan in respect for this law, and so commanding us to make the thought of\\nduty, which strikes down all\\narrogance\\nas well as vain\\nself-love\\n, the supreme\\nlife-principle\\nof all morality in human beings.\\nIf this is so, then not only novelists and sentimental educators (even though\\nthey may be strongly opposed to sentimentalism) but sometimes even philos-\\nophers\\n–\\nand even the most austere of all, the Stoics\\n–\\nhave ushered in\\nmoral\\nenthusiasm\\ninstead of a sober but wise moral discipline, though the enthusiasm\\nof the latter was more heroic while that of the former is of a more insipid and\\nlanguishing character; and one can, without hypocrisy, say quite truly of the\\nmoral teaching of the Gospel that, by the purity of its moral principle but at\\nthe same time by the suitability of this principle to the limitations of\\nﬁ\\nnite\\nbeings, it\\nﬁ\\nrst subjected all good conduct of man to the discipline of a duty laid\\nbefore his eyes, which does not allow them to rove among fancied moral\\nperfections, and set limits of humility (i.e., self-knowledge) to self-conceit as\\nwell as to self-love, both of which are ready to mistake their boundaries.\\nDuty!\\nSublime and mighty name that embraces nothing charming or\\ninsinuating but requires submission, and yet does not seek to move the will\\nby threatening anything that would arouse natural aversion or terror in the\\nmind but only holds forth a law that of itself\\nﬁ\\nnds entry into the mind and yet\\ngains reluctant reverence (though not always obedience), a law before which\\nall inclinations are dumb, even though they secretly work against it; what\\norigin is there worthy of you, and where is to be found the root of your noble\\ndescent which proudly rejects all kinship with the inclinations, descent from\\nwhich is the indispensable condition of that worth which human beings alone\\ncan give themselves?\\nIt can be nothing less than what elevates a human being above himself (as a\\npart of the sensible world), what connects him with an order of things that only\\nthe understanding can think and that at the same time has under it the whole\\nsensible world and with it the empirically determinable\\n5:87\\nexistence of human\\nbeings in time and the whole of all ends (which is alone suitable to such\\nunconditional practical laws as the moral). It is nothing other than\\npersonality\\n,\\nthat is, freedom and independence from the mechanism of the whole of natur\\ne,\\nregarded nevertheless as also a capacity of a being subject to special laws\\n–\\nnamely pure practical laws given by his own reason, so that a person as b\\nelonging\\nto the sensible world is subject to his own personality insofar as he also be\\nlongs to\\nthe intelligible world; for, it is then not to be wondered at that a hum\\nan being, as\\nbelonging to both worlds, must regard his own nature in reference to his\\nsecond\\nand highest vocation only with reverence, and its laws with the highest\\nrespect.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n71On this origin are based many expressions that indicate the worth of objects\\naccording to moral ideas. The moral law is\\nholy\\n(inviolable). A human being is\\nindeed unholy enough but the\\nhumanity\\nin his person must be holy to him. In\\nthe whole of creation everything one wants and over which one has any power\\ncan also be used\\nmerely as a means\\n; a human being alone, and with him every\\nrational creature, is an\\nend in itself\\n: by virtue of the autonomy of his freedom he\\nis the subject of the moral law, which is holy. Just because of this every will,\\neven every person\\n’\\ns own will directed to himself, is restricted to the condition\\nof agreement with the\\nautonomy\\nof the rational being, that is to say, such a\\nbeing is not to be subjected to any purpose that is not possible in accordance\\nwith a law that could arise from the will of the affected\\nl\\nsubject himself; hence\\nthis subject is to be used never merely as a means but as at the same time an\\nend. We rightly attribute this condition even to the divine will with respect to\\nthe rational beings in the world as its creatures, inasmuch as it rests on their\\npersonality\\n, by which alone they are ends in themselves.\\nThis idea of personality, awakening respect by setting before our eyes the\\nsublimity of our nature (in its vocation) while at the same time showing us the\\nlack of accord of our conduct with respect to it and thus striking down self-\\nconceit, is natural even to the most common human reason and is easily\\nobserved. Has not every even moderately honorable man sometimes found\\nthat he has abstained from an otherwise harmless lie by which\\n5:88\\nhe could either\\nhave extricated himself from a troublesome affair or even procured some\\nadvantage for a beloved and deserving friend, solely in order not to have to\\ndespise himself secretly in his own eyes? When an upright man is in the\\ngreatest distress, which he could have avoided if he could only have disre-\\ngarded duty, is he not sustained by the consciousness that he has maintained\\nhumanity in its proper dignity in his own person and honored it, that he has no\\ncause to shame himself in his own eyes and to dread the inward view of self-\\nexamination? This consolation is not happiness, not even the smallest part of\\nit. For, no one would wish the occasion for it on himself, or perhaps even a life\\nin such circumstances. But he lives and cannot bear to be unworthy of life in\\nhis own eyes. This inner tranquility is therefore merely negative with respect\\nto everything that can make life pleasant; it is, namely, only warding off the\\ndanger of sinking in personal worth, after he has given up completely the\\nworth of his condition. It is the effect of a respect for something quite different\\nfrom life, something in comparison and contrast with which life with all its\\nagreeableness has no worth at all. He still lives only from duty, not because he\\nhas the least taste for living.\\nThis is how the genuine moral incentive of pure practical reason is con-\\nstituted; it is nothing other than the pure moral law itself insofar as it lets us\\ndiscover the sublimity of our own supersensible existence and subjectively\\nl\\nleidenden\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n72effects respect for their higher vocation in human beings, who are at the same\\ntime conscious of their sensible existence and of the dependence, connected\\nwith it, on their pathologically affected nature. Now, so many charms and\\nattractions of life may well be connected with this incentive that even for their\\nsake alone the most prudent choice of a reasonable Epicurean, re\\nﬂ\\necting on the\\ngreatest well-being of life, would declare itself for moral conduct; and it can\\neven be advisable to connect this prospect of a cheerful enjoyment of life with\\nthat motive which is supreme and already suf\\nﬁ\\nciently determining of itself;\\nbut this connection should be made only to counterbalance the allurements\\nthat vice does not fail to display on the opposite side, and not so as to place in\\nthis the proper moving force, not even the smallest part of it, when it is a\\nquestion of duty. For that would be tantamount to wanting to taint the pure\\nmoral disposition\\n5:89\\nin its source. The majesty of duty has nothing to do with the\\nenjoyment of life; it has its own law and also its own court, and even though\\none might want to shake both of them together thoroughly, so as to give them\\nblended, like medicine, to the sick soul, they soon separate of themselves; if\\nthey do not, the former will effect nothing at all, and though physical life\\nmight gain some force, the moral life would fade away irrecoverably.\\nCRITICAL ELUCIDATION OF THE ANALYTIC OF\\nPURE PRACTICAL REASON\\nBy the critical elucidation of a science, or of a portion of it that constitutes a\\nsystem by itself, I understand the investigation and justi\\nﬁ\\ncation of why it must\\nhave precisely this and no other systematic form when it is compared with\\nanother system having a similar cognitive faculty as its basis. Now, practical\\nreason has as its basis the same cognitive faculty as does speculative reason so\\nfar as both are\\npure reason\\n. Therefore the difference in the systematic form of\\nthe one from that of the other must be determined by a comparison of the two,\\nand the ground of this difference must be assigned.\\nThe Analytic of pure theoretical reason had to do with cognition of such\\nobjects as could be given to the understanding; it thus had to begin from\\nintuition\\nand consequently (since this is always sensible) from sensibility, and\\nonly then progress to concepts (of the objects of this intuition), and could end\\nwith\\nprinciples\\nonly after preparation by way of both these. Practical reason, on\\nthe contrary, since it does not have to do with objects for the sake of\\ncognizing\\nthem but with its own ability\\nto make them real\\n(conformably with cognition of\\nthem), that is, with a\\nwill\\nthat is a causality inasmuch as reason contains its\\ndetermining ground; since, accordingly, it does not have to provide an object\\nof intuition but, as practical reason,\\nonly a law\\nfor such an object (because the\\nconcept of causality always contains reference to a law that determines the\\nexistence of a manifold in relation to one another); it follows that a critique of\\nthe Analytic of reason, insofar as it is to be a practical reason (and this is the\\nreal problem), must begin\\n5:90\\nfrom the\\npossibility of practical principles\\na priori.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n73Only from these could it proceed to\\nconcepts\\nof objects of a practical reason,\\nnamely, to the concepts of the simply good and evil, in order\\nﬁ\\nrst to give them\\nin keeping with those principles (for, prior to those principles these cannot\\npossibly be given as good and evil by any cognitive faculty), and only then\\ncould the last chapter conclude this part, namely the chapter about the relation\\nof pure practical reason to sensibility and about its necessary in\\nﬂ\\nuence upon\\nsensibility to be cognized a priori, that is, about\\nmoral feeling\\n. Thus the\\nAnalytic of practical pure reason divides the whole sphere of all the conditions\\nof its use quite analogously with that of theoretical reason, but in reverse order.\\nThe Analytic of theoretical pure reason was divided into transcendental\\nAesthetic and transcendental Logic; that of practical reason, reversely, into\\nLogic and Aesthetic of pure practical reason (if I may be allowed, merely by an\\nanalogy, to use these terms, which are not altogether suitable); the Logic in\\nturn was there divided into Analytic of concepts and Analytic of principles,\\nhere into that of principles and concepts. The Aesthetic there had two parts,\\nbecause of the twofold kind of sensible intuition; here sensibility is not\\nregarded as a capacity for intuition at all but only as feeling (which can be a\\nsubjective ground of desire), and with respect to it pure practical reason\\nadmits no further division.\\nAs to why this division into two parts with their subdivision was not\\nactually undertaken here (as one might initially have been induced to\\nattempt by the example of the\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nCritique\\n), this is easily seen. For, since\\nit is\\npure reason\\nthat is here considered in its pra\\nctical use, and consequently\\nas proceeding from a priori principle\\ns and not from empirical determining\\ngrounds, the division of the Analytic of pure practical reason must turn out\\nlike that of a syllogism, namely, proc\\needing from the universal in the\\nmajor\\npremise\\n(the moral principle), through undertaking in a\\nminor premise\\na\\nsubsumption of possible actions (as g\\nood or evil) under the former, to the\\nconclusion\\n, namely, the subjective determination of the will (an interest in the\\npractically possible good and in the maxim based on it). For someone who\\nhas been able to convince himself\\nof the propositions presented\\n5:91\\nin the\\nAnalytic such comparisons will be gratifying; for they rightly occasion the\\nexpectation of perhaps being able some day to attain insight into the unity of\\nthe whole pure rational faculty (theoretical as well as practical) and to derive\\neverything from one principle\\n–\\nthe undeniable need of human reason,\\nwhich\\nﬁ\\nnds complete satisfaction only in a complete systematic unity of its\\ncognitions.\\nBut if we now consider also the content of the cognition that we can have of\\na pure practical reason and by means of it, as the Analytic of pure practical\\nreason presents this content, there is found, along with a remarkable analogy\\nbetween it and the theoretical, no less remarkable differences. With respect to\\nthe theoretical, the\\nfaculty of a pure rational cognition\\na priori could be quite\\neasily and evidently proved through examples from the sciences (in which,\\nsince they put their principles to the test in so many ways by methodic use, one\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n74need not fear so much as in common cognition a secret mixture of empirical\\ngrounds of cognition). But that pure reason, without the admixture of any\\nempirical determining ground, is practical of itself alone: this one had to be\\nable to show from the\\nmost common practical use of reason\\n, by con\\nﬁ\\nrming the\\nsupreme practical principle as one that every natural human reason cognizes\\n–\\na law completely a priori and independent of any sensible data\\n–\\nas the\\nsupreme law of its will. It was necessary\\nﬁ\\nrst to establish and justify the purity\\nof its origin even\\nin the judgment of this common reason\\nbefore science would\\ntake it in hand in order to make use of it, so to speak, as a fact that precedes all\\nsubtle reasoning about its possibility and all the consequences that may be\\ndrawn from it. But this circumstance can also be very well explained from\\nwhat has just been said; it is because practical pure reason must necessarily\\nbegin from principles, which must therefore, as the\\nﬁ\\nrst data, be put at the\\nbasis of all science and cannot\\nﬁ\\nrst arise from it. But for this reason the\\njusti\\nﬁ\\ncation of moral principles as principles of a pure reason could also be\\ncarried out very well and with suf\\nﬁ\\ncient certainty by a mere appeal to the\\njudgment of common human understanding, because anything empirical that\\nmight slip into our maxims as a determining ground of the\\n5:92\\nwill\\nmakes itself\\nknown\\nat once by the feeling of grati\\nﬁ\\ncation or pain that necessarily attaches to\\nit insofar as it arouses desire, whereas pure practical reason directly\\nopposes\\ntaking this feeling into its principle as a condition. The dissimilarity of\\ndetermining grounds (empirical and rational) is made known by this resistance\\nof a practically lawgiving reason to every meddling inclination, by a special\\nkind of\\nfeeling\\n, which, however, does not precede the lawgiving of practical\\nreason but is instead produced only by it and indeed as a constraint, namely,\\nthrough the feeling of a respect such as no human being has for inclinations of\\nwhatever kind but does have for the law; and it is made known so saliently and\\nso prominently that no one, not even the most common human understand-\\ning, can fail to see at once, in an example presented to him, that he can\\nindeed be advised by empirical grounds of volition to follow their charms\\nbut that he can never be expected to\\nobey\\nanything but the pure practical law\\nof reason alone.\\nThe distinction of the\\ndoctrine of happiness\\nfrom the\\ndoctrine of morals\\n, in the\\nﬁ\\nrst of which empirical principles constitute the whole foundation whereas in\\nthe second they do not make even the smallest addition to it, is the\\nﬁ\\nrst and\\nmost important business incumbent upon the Analytic of pure practical\\nreason, in which it must proceed as\\nprecisely\\nand, so to speak, as\\nscrupulously\\nas any geometer in his work. A philosopher, however, has greater dif\\nﬁ\\nculties\\nto contend with here (as always in rational cognition through mere concepts\\nwithout construction of them), because he cannot put any intuition (a pure\\nnoumenon) at its basis. He has, however, the advantage that, almost like a\\nchemist, he can at any time set up an experiment with every human practical\\nreason in order to distinguish the moral (pure) determining ground from the\\nempirical, namely, by adding the moral law (as a determining ground) to the\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n75empirically affected will (e.g., that of someone who would gladly lie because he\\ncan gain something by it). When an analyst adds alkali to a solution of\\ncalcareous earth in hydrochloric acid, the acid at once releases\\nm\\nthe lime and\\nunites with the alkali, and the lime is precipitated. In just the same way, if a\\nman who is otherwise honest (or who just this once puts himself only in\\n5:93\\nthought in the place of an honest man) is confronted with the moral law in\\nwhich he cognizes the worthlessness of a liar, his practical reason (in its\\njudgment of what he ought to do) at once abandons\\nn\\nthe advantage, unites\\nwith what maintains in him respect for his own person (truthfulness), and the\\nadvantage, after it has been separated and washed from every particle of reason\\n(which is altogether on the side of duty), is weighed by everyone, so that it can\\nenter into combination with reason in other cases, only not where it could be\\nopposed to the moral law, which reason never abandons but unites with most\\nintimately.\\nBut this\\ndistinction\\nof the principle of happiness from that of morality is not,\\nfor this reason, at once an\\nopposition\\nbetween them, and pure practical reason\\ndoes not require\\no\\nthat one should\\nrenounce\\nclaims to happiness but only that as\\nsoon as duty is in question one should\\ntake no account\\nof them. It can even in\\ncertain respects be a duty to attend to one\\n’\\ns happiness, partly because happi-\\nness (to which belong skill, health, wealth) contains means for the ful\\nﬁ\\nllment\\nof one\\n’\\ns duty and partly because lack of it (e.g., poverty) contains temptations\\nto transgress one\\n’\\ns duty. However, it can never be a direct duty to promote\\none\\n’\\ns happiness, still less can it be a principle of all duty. Now, because all\\ndetermining grounds of the will except the one and only pure practical law of\\nreason (the moral law) are without exception empirical and so, as such, belong\\nto the principle of happiness, they must without exception be separated from\\nthe supreme moral principle and never be incorporated with it as a condition,\\nsince this would destroy all moral worth just as any empirical admixture to\\ngeometrical principles would destroy all mathematical evidence, which (in\\nPlato\\n’\\ns judgment) is the most excellent thing in mathematics, surpassing even\\nits utility.\\nBut instead of the deduction of the supreme principle of pure practical\\nreason\\n–\\nthat is, the explanation of the possibility of such a cognition a priori\\n–\\nnothing more could be adduced than that, if one had insight into the possi-\\nbility of freedom of an ef\\nﬁ\\ncient cause, one would also have insight into not\\nmerely the possibility but even the necessity of the moral law as the supreme\\npractical law of rational beings, to whom one attributes freedom of the\\ncausality of their will; for, the two concepts are so inseparably connected\\nthat one could even de\\nﬁ\\nne practical freedom through independence of the\\n5:94\\nwill\\nfrom anything other than the moral law alone. But no insight can be had into\\nm\\nverläßt\\nn\\nverläßt\\no\\nwill nicht\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n76the possibility of the freedom of an ef\\nﬁ\\ncient cause, especially in the sensible\\nworld: we are fortunate if only we can be suf\\nﬁ\\nciently assured that there is no\\nproof of its impossibility, and are now forced to assume it and are thereby\\njusti\\nﬁ\\ned in doing so by the moral law, which postulates it. For, there are many\\nwho believe that they can nevertheless explain this freedom in accordance\\nwith empirical principles, like any other natural ability, and regard it as a\\npsychological\\nproperty, the explanation of which simply requires a more exact\\ninvestigation of the\\nnature of the soul\\nand of the incentives of the will, and not as\\na\\ntranscendental\\npredicate of the causality of a being that belongs to the sensible\\nworld (although this is all that is really at issue here); and they thus deprive us\\nof the grand disclosure brought to us through practical reason by means of the\\nmoral law, the disclosure, namely of an intelligible world through realization of\\nthe otherwise transcendent concept of freedom, and with this deprive us of the\\nmoral law itself, which admits absolutely no empirical determining ground. It\\nwill therefore be necessary to add something here as a protection against this\\ndelusion, and to show\\nempiricism\\nin all its bare super\\nﬁ\\nciality.\\nThe concept of causality as\\nnatural necessity\\n, as distinguished from the\\nconcept of causality as\\nfreedom\\n, concerns only the existence of things insofar as\\nit is\\ndeterminable in time\\nand hence as appearances, as opposed to their causality\\nas things in themselves. Now, if one takes the determinations of the existence\\nof things in time for determinations of things in themselves (which is the most\\nusual way of representing them), then the necessity in the causal relation can\\nin no way be united with freedom; instead they are opposed to each other as\\ncontradictory. For, from the\\nﬁ\\nrst it follows that every event, and consequently\\nevery action that takes place at a point of time, is necessary under the condition\\nof what was in the preceding time. Now, since time past is no longer within my\\ncontrol, every action that I perform must be necessary by determining\\ngrounds\\nthat are not within my control\\n, that is, I am never free at the point of\\ntime in which I act. Indeed, even if I assume that my whole existence is\\nindependent from\\n5:95\\nany alien cause (such as God), so that the determining\\ngrounds of my causality and even of my whole existence are not outside me,\\nthis would not in the least transform that natural necessity into freedom. For,\\nat every point of time I still stand under the necessity of being determined to\\naction by\\nthat which is not within my control\\n, and the series of events in\\nﬁ\\nnite a\\nparte priori which I can only continue in accordance with a predetermined\\norder would never begin of itself: it would be a continuous natural chain, and\\ntherefore my causality would never be freedom.\\nIf, then, one wants to attribute freedom to a being whose existence is\\ndetermined in time, one cannot, so far at least, except this being from the\\nlaw of natural necessity as to all events in its existence and consequently as to\\nits actions as well; for, that would be tantamount to handing it over to blind\\nchance. But since this law unavoidably concerns all causality of things so far as\\ntheir existence in time\\nis determinable, if this were the way in which one had to\\nrepresent also the\\nexistence of these things in themselves\\nthen freedom would\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n77have to be rejected as a null and impossible concept. Consequently, if one still\\nwants to save it, no other path remains than to ascribe the existence of a thing\\nso far as it is determinable in time, and so too its causality in accordance with\\nthe law of\\nnatural necessity, only to appearance, and to ascribe freedom to the same\\nbeing as a thing in itself\\n. This is certainly unavoidable if one wants to maintain\\nboth these mutually repellent concepts together; but in application, when one\\nwants to explain them as united in one and the same action, and so to explain\\nthis union itself, great dif\\nﬁ\\nculties come forward, which seem to make such a\\nuni\\nﬁ\\ncation unfeasible.\\np\\nIf I say of a human being who commits a theft that this deed is, in\\naccordance with the natural law of causality, a necessary result of determining\\ngrounds in preceding time, then it was impossible that it could have been left\\nundone; how, then, can appraisal in accordance with the moral law make any\\nchange in it and suppose that it could have been omitted because the law says\\nthat it ought to have been omitted? That is, how can that man be called quite\\nfree at the same point of time and in regard to the same action in which and in\\nregard to which he is nevertheless subject to an unavoidable\\n5:96\\nnatural necessity?\\nIt is a wretched subterfuge to seek to evade this by saying that the\\nkind\\nof\\ndetermining grounds of his causality in accordance with natural law agrees\\nwith a\\ncomparative\\nconcept of freedom (according to which that is sometimes\\ncalled a free effect, the determining natural ground of which lies\\nwithin\\nthe\\nacting being, e.g., that which a projectile accomplishes when it is in free\\nmotion, in which case one uses the word\\n“\\nfreedom\\n”\\nbecause while it is in\\nﬂ\\night it is not impelled from without; or as we also call the motion of a clock a\\nfree motion because it moves the hands itself, which therefore do not need to\\nbe pushed externally; in the same way the actions of the human being,\\nalthough they are necessary by their determining grounds which preceded\\nthem in time, are yet called free because the actions are caused from within, by\\nrepresentations produced by our own powers, whereby desires are evoked on\\noccasion of circumstances and hence actions are produced at our own dis-\\ncretion). Some still let themselves be put off by this subterfuge and so think\\nthey have solved, with a little quibbling about words, that dif\\nﬁ\\ncult problem on\\nthe solution of which millennia have worked in vain and which can therefore\\nhardly be found so completely on the surface. That is to say, in the question\\nabout that freedom which must be put at the basis of all moral laws and the\\nimputation appropriate to them, it does not matter whether the causality\\ndetermined in accordance with a natural law is necessary through determining\\ngrounds lying\\nwithin\\nthe subject or\\noutside\\nhim, or in the\\nﬁ\\nrst case whether\\nthese determining grounds are instinctive or thought by reason; if, as is\\nadmitted by these men themselves, these determining representations have\\nthe ground of their existence in time and indeed in the\\nantecedent state\\n, and\\np\\nuntunlich\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n78this in turn in a preceding state, and so forth, so that these determinations may\\nbe internal and they may have psychological instead of mechanical causality,\\nthat is, produce actions by means of representations and not by bodily move-\\nments: they are always\\ndetermining grounds\\nof the causality of a being insofar as\\nits existence is determinable in time and therefore under the necessitating\\nconditions of past time, which are thus, when the subject is to act,\\nno longer\\nwithin his control\\nand which may therefore bring with them psychological\\nfreedom (if one wants to use this term for a merely internal chain of repre-\\nsentations in the soul) but nevertheless natural necessity; and they therefore\\nleave no\\n5:97\\ntranscendental freedom\\n, which must be thought as independence from\\neverything empirical and so from nature generally, whether it is regarded as an\\nobject of inner sense in time only or also of outer sense in both space and time;\\nwithout this freedom (in the latter and proper sense), which alone is practical a\\npriori, no moral law is possible and no imputation in accordance with it. Just\\nfor this reason, all necessity of events in time in accordance with the natural\\nlaw of causality can be called the\\nmechanism\\nof nature, although it is not meant\\nby this that the things which are subject to it must be really material\\nmachines\\n.\\nHere one looks only to the necessity of the connection of events in a time series\\nas it develops in accordance with natural law, whether the subject in which this\\ndevelopment takes place is called\\nautomaton materiale\\n, when the machinery is\\ndriven by matter, or with Leibniz\\nspirituale\\n, when it is driven by representa-\\ntions; and if the freedom of our will were none other than the latter (say,\\npsychological and comparative but not also transcendental, i.e., absolute), then\\nit would at bottom be nothing better than the freedom of a turnspit, which,\\nwhen once it is wound up, also accomplishes its movements of itself.\\nNow, in order, in the case at hand, to remove the apparent contradiction\\nbetween the mechanism of nature and freedom in one and the same action, one\\nmust recall what was said in the\\nCritique of Pure Reason\\nor follows from it: that\\nthe natural necessity which cannot coexist with the freedom of the subject\\nattaches merely to the determinations of a thing which stands under condi-\\ntions of time and so only to the determinations of the acting subject as\\nappearance, and that, accordingly, the determining grounds of every action\\nof the subject so far lie in what belongs to past time and\\nis no longer within his\\ncontrol\\n(in which must be counted his past deeds and the character as a\\nphenomenon thereby determinable for him in his own eyes). But the very\\nsame subject, being on the other side conscious of himself as a thing in itself,\\nalso views his existence\\ninsofar as it does not stand under conditions of time\\nand\\nhimself as determinable only through laws that he gives himself by reason; and\\nin this existence of his nothing is, for him, antecedent to the determination of\\nhis will, but every action\\n–\\nand in general every determination of his existence\\nchanging\\n5:98\\nconformably with inner sense, even the whole sequence of his\\nexistence as a sensible being\\n–\\nis to be regarded in the consciousness of his\\nintelligible existence as nothing but the consequence and never as the deter-\\nmining ground of his causality as a\\nnoumenon\\n. So considered, a rational being\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n79can now rightly say of every unlawful action he performed that he could have\\nomitted it even though as appearance it is suf\\nﬁ\\nciently determined in the past\\nand, so far, is inevitably necessary; for this action, with all the past which\\ndetermines it, belongs to a single phenomenon of his character, which he gives\\nto himself and in accordance with which he imputes to himself, as a cause\\nindependent of all sensibility, the causality of those appearances.\\nThe judicial sentences of that wonderful capacity in us which we call\\nconscience are in perfect agreement with this. A human being may use what\\nart he will to paint some unlawful conduct he remembers as an unintentional\\nfault\\nq\\n–\\nas a mere oversight which one can never avoid altogether, and so as\\nsomething in which he was carried away by the stream of natural necessity\\n–\\nand to declare himself innocent of it; he nevertheless\\nﬁ\\nnds that the advocate\\nwho speaks in his favor can by no means reduce to silence the prosecutor\\nwithin him, if only he is aware that at the time he did this wrong he was in his\\nsenses, that is, had the use of his freedom; and while he\\nexplains\\nhis mis-\\nconduct by certain bad habits, which by gradual neglect of attention he has\\nallowed to grow in him to such a degree that he can regard his misconduct as\\ntheir natural consequence, yet this cannot protect him from the reproach and\\ncensure he casts upon himself. This is also the ground of repentance for a deed\\nlong past at every recollection of it, a painful feeling aroused by the moral\\ndisposition, which is empty in a practical way to the extent that it cannot serve\\nto undo what has been done and would even be absurd (and Priestley,\\n10\\na\\ngenuine\\nfatalist\\nproceeding consistently, declares it absurd; and for this candor\\nhe deserves more applause than those who, while maintaining the mechanism\\nof the will in deeds\\nr\\nbut its freedom in words, yet want it to be thought that\\nthey include it in their syncretistic system, though without\\n5:99\\nmaking the\\npossibility of such imputation comprehensible); but repentance, as pain, is\\nstill quite legitimate because reason, when it is a question of the law of our\\nintelligible existence (the moral law), recognizes no distinction of time and\\nasks only whether the event belongs to me as a deed and, if it does, then always\\nconnects the same feeling with it morally, whether it was done just now or long\\nago. For, the\\nsensible life\\nhas, with respect to the\\nintelligible\\nconsciousness of its\\nexistence (consciousness of freedom), the absolute unity of a phenomenon,\\nwhich, so far as it contains merely appearances of the disposition that the\\nmoral law is concerned with (appearances of the character), must be appraised\\nnot in accordance with the natural necessity that belongs to it as appearance\\nbut in accordance with the absolute spontaneity of freedom. One can therefore\\ngrant that if it were possible for us to have such deep insight into a human\\nbeing\\n’\\ns cast of mind, as shown by inner as well as outer actions, that we would\\nknow every incentive to action, even the smallest, as well as all the external\\noccasions affecting them, we could calculate a human being\\n’\\ns conduct for the\\nq\\nVersehen\\nr\\nin der Tat\\n. For a de\\nﬁ\\nnition of\\n“\\ndeed\\n”\\nsee\\nThe Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n224\\n).\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n80future with as much certainty as a lunar or solar eclipse and could nevertheless\\nmaintain that the human being\\n’\\ns conduct is free. If, that is to say, we were\\ncapable of another view, namely an intellectual intuition of the same subject\\n(which is certainly not given to us and in place of which we have only the\\nrational concept), then we would become aware that this whole chain of\\nappearances, with respect to all that the moral law is concerned with, depends\\nupon the spontaneity of the subject as a thing in itself, for the determination of\\nwhich no physical explanation can be given. In default of this intuition, the\\nmoral law assures us of this difference between the relation of our actions as\\nappearances to the sensible being of our subject and relation by which this\\nsensible being is itself referred to the intelligible substratum in us. From this\\nperspective, which is natural to our reason though inexplicable, appraisals can\\nbe justi\\nﬁ\\ned which, though made in all conscientiousness, yet seem at\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nglance quite contrary to all equity. There are cases in which human beings,\\neven with the same education that was pro\\nﬁ\\ntable to others, yet show from\\nchildhood such early wickedness\\ns\\nand progress in it so continuously into their\\nadulthood that they are taken to be born villains and quite incapable of\\n5:100\\nimprovement as far as their cast of mind is concerned; and nevertheless they\\nare so judged for what they do or leave undone that they are censured as guilty\\nof their crimes; indeed, they themselves (the children)\\nﬁ\\nnd these censures as\\nwell founded as if, despite the hopeless natural constitution of mind\\nt\\nascribed\\nto them, they remained as accountable as any other human being. This could\\nnot happen if we did not suppose that whatever arises from one\\n’\\ns choice (as\\nevery action intentionally performed undoubtedly does) has as its basis a free\\ncausality, which from early youth expresses its character in its appearances\\n(actions); these actions, on account of the uniformity of conduct, make\\nknowable a natural connection that does not, however, make the vicious\\nu\\nconstitution of the will necessary but is instead the consequence of the evil\\nand unchangeable principles freely\\nv\\nadopted, which make it only more culpa-\\nble and deserving of punishment.\\nBut a dif\\nﬁ\\nculty still awaits freedom insofar as it is to be united with the\\nmechanism of nature in a being that belongs to the sensible world, a dif\\nﬁ\\nculty\\nwhich, even after all the foregoing has been agreed to, still threatens freedom\\nwith complete destruction. In this danger there is at the same time, however, a\\ncircumstance that offers hope of an outcome still favorable to maintaining\\nfreedom, namely that the same dif\\nﬁ\\nculty presses much more strongly (in fact,\\nas we shall presently see, presses only) upon the system in which existence\\ndeterminable in time and space is held to be the existence of things in\\nthemselves; hence it does not force us to give up our main supposition of\\ns\\nBosheit\\nt\\nNaturbeschaffenheit ihres Gemüts\\nu\\narge\\nv\\nfreiwillig\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n81the ideality of time as a mere form of sensible intuition and so as merely a way\\nof representing things that is proper to the subject as belonging to the sensible\\nworld; and thus the dif\\nﬁ\\nculty only requires us to unite this supposition with\\nthe idea of freedom.\\nThat is to say: if it is granted us that the intelligible subject can still be free\\nwith respect to a given action, although as a subject also belonging to the\\nsensible world, he is mechanically conditioned with respect to the same action,\\nit nevertheless seems that, as soon as one admits that\\nGod\\nas universal original\\nbeing\\nis the cause also of the existence of substance\\n(a proposition that can never\\nbe given up without also giving up the concept of God as the being of all\\nbeings and with it his all-suf\\nﬁ\\nciency, on which everything in theology\\ndepends), one must admit that a human being\\n’\\ns actions\\n5:101\\nhave their determining\\nground in\\nsomething altogether beyond his control\\n, namely in the causality of a\\nsupreme being which is distinct from him and upon which his own existence\\nand the entire determination of his causality absolutely depend. In fact, if a\\nhuman being\\n’\\ns actions insofar as they belong to his determinations in time\\nwere not merely determinations of him as appearance but as a thing in itself,\\nfreedom could not be saved. A human being would be a marionette or an\\nautomaton, like Vaucason\\n’\\ns,\\n11\\nbuilt and wound up by the supreme artist; self-\\nconsciousness would indeed make him a thinking automaton, but the con-\\nsciousness of his own spontaneity, if taken for freedom, would be mere\\ndelusion inasmuch as it deserves to be called freedom only comparatively,\\nbecause the proximate determining causes of its motion and a long series of\\ntheir determining causes are indeed internal but the last and highest is found\\nentirely in an alien hand. Therefore I do not see how those who insist on\\nregarding time and space as determinations belonging to the existence of\\nthings in themselves would avoid fatalism of actions; or if (like the otherwise\\nacute Mendelssohn)\\n12\\nthey\\nﬂ\\natly allow both to be conditions necessarily\\nbelonging only to the existence of\\nﬁ\\nnite and derived beings but not to that\\nof the in\\nﬁ\\nnite original being, I do not see how they would justify themselves in\\nmaking such a distinction, whence they get a warrant to do so, or even how\\nthey would avoid the contradiction they encounter when they regard existence\\nin time as a determination attaching necessarily to\\nﬁ\\nnite things in themselves,\\nwhile God is the cause of this existence but cannot be the cause of time (or\\nspace) itself (because this must be presupposed as a necessary a priori con-\\ndition of the existence of things); and consequently his causality with respect\\nto the existence of these things must be conditioned and even temporally\\nconditioned; and this would unavoidably have to bring in all that is contra-\\ndictory to the concept of his in\\nﬁ\\nnity and independence. On the other hand, it\\nis quite easy for us to distinguish between the determination of the divine\\nexistence as independent of all temporal conditions and that of a being of the\\nsensible world, the distinction being that between\\nthe existence of a being in\\nitself\\nand that of a\\nthing in appearance\\n. Hence, if this ideality of time and space\\nis not adopted, nothing remains but Spinozism, in which space and time are\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n82essential\\n5:102\\ndeterminations of the original being itself, while the things depend-\\nent upon it (ourselves, therefore, included) are not substances but merely\\naccidents inhering in it; for, if these things exist merely as its effects\\nin time\\n,\\nwhich would be the condition of their existence itself, then the actions of these\\nbeings would have to be merely its actions that it performs in any place and at\\nany time. Thus Spinozism, despite the absurdity of its fundamental idea,\\nargues more consistently than the creation theory can when beings assumed to\\nbe substances and\\nin themselves existing in time\\nare regarded as effects of a\\nsupreme cause and yet as not belonging to him and his action but as substances\\nin themselves.\\nThe dif\\nﬁ\\nculty mentioned above is resolved brie\\nﬂ\\ny and clearly as follows. If\\nexistence\\nin time\\nis only a sensible way of representing things which belongs to\\nthinking beings in the world and consequently does not apply to them as\\nthings in themselves, then the creation of these beings is a creation of things in\\nthemselves, since the concept of a creation does not belong to the sensible way\\nof representing existence or causality but can only be referred to noumena.\\nConsequently, if I say of beings in the sensible world that they are created, I so\\nfar regard them as noumena. Just as it would thus be a contradiction to say that\\nGod is a creator of appearances, so it is also a contradiction to say that as\\ncreator he is the cause of actions in the sensible world and thus of actions as\\nappearances, even though he is the cause of the existence of the acting beings\\n(as noumena). If it is now possible to af\\nﬁ\\nrm freedom without compromising\\nthe natural mechanism of actions as appearances (by taking existence in time to\\nbe something that holds only of appearances, not of things in themselves),\\nthen it cannot make the slightest difference that the acting beings are crea-\\ntures, since creation has to do with their intelligible but not their sensible\\nexistence and therefore cannot be regarded as the determining ground of\\nappearances; but it would turn out quite differently if the beings in the world\\nas things in themselves existed\\nin time\\n, since the creator of substance would\\nalso be the author of the entire mechanism in this substance.\\nOf such great importance is the separation of time (as well as space)\\n5:103\\nfrom\\nthe existence of things in themselves that was accomplished in the\\nCritique\\nof\\npure speculative reason.\\nIt will be said that the solution to the dif\\nﬁ\\nculty given here involves even\\ngreater dif\\nﬁ\\nculty and is hardly susceptible of a lucid presentation. But is any\\nother solution that has been attempted, or that may be attempted, easier and\\nmore apprehensible? One might rather say that the dogmatic teachers of\\nmetaphysics have shown more shrewdness than sincerity in keeping this\\ndif\\nﬁ\\ncult point out of sight as much as possible, in the hope that if they said\\nnothing about it no one would be likely to think of it. If a science is to be\\nadvanced, all dif\\nﬁ\\nculties must be\\nexposed\\nand we must even\\nsearch\\nfor those,\\nhowever well hidden, that lie in its way; for, every dif\\nﬁ\\nculty calls forth a\\nremedy that cannot be found without science gaining either in extent or in\\ndeterminateness, so that even obstacles become means for promoting the\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n83thoroughness of science. On the contrary, if the dif\\nﬁ\\nculties are purposely\\nconcealed or removed merely through palliatives, then sooner or later they\\nbreak out in incurable troubles that bring science to ruin in a complete\\nskepticism.\\n∵\\nSince it is really the concept of freedom that, among all the ideas of pure\\nspeculative reason, alone provides such a great extension in the\\nﬁ\\neld of the\\nsupersensible, though only with respect to practical cognition, I ask myself\\nwhy it exclusively has such great fruitfulness\\nwhereas the others indeed indicate\\nthe vacant place for possible beings of the pure understanding but cannot\\ndetermine the concept of them by anything. I soon see that, since I can think\\nnothing without a category, a category must\\nﬁ\\nrst be sought in reason\\n’\\ns idea of\\nfreedom with which I am now concerned, which is here the category of\\ncausality\\n; and I see that, even though no corresponding intuition can be put\\nunder the\\nrational concept\\nof freedom, which is a transcendent concept, never-\\ntheless a sensible intuition must\\nﬁ\\nrst be given for the\\nconcept of the under-\\nstanding\\n(of causality)\\n–\\nfor the synthesis of which the\\nrational concept of\\nfreedom\\nrequires the unconditioned\\n–\\nby which\\n5:104\\nit is\\nﬁ\\nrst assured objective\\nreality. Now, all the categories are divided into two classes: the\\nmathematical\\n,\\nwhich are directed merely to the unity of synthesis in the representation of\\nobjects, and the\\ndynamical\\n, which are directed to the unity of synthesis in the\\nrepresentation of the existence of objects. The former (those of quantity and\\nquality) always contain a synthesis of the\\nhomogeneous\\n, in which the uncon-\\nditioned can never be found for the conditioned in space and time given in\\nsensible intuition since it itself belongs in turn to space and time and must thus\\nin turn always be conditioned; hence in the Dialectic of pure theoretical reason\\nthe two opposed ways of\\nﬁ\\nnding the unconditioned and the totality of the\\nconditions for it were both false. The categories of the second class (those of\\nthe causality and of the necessity of a thing) did not at all require this\\nhomogeneity (of the conditioned and the condition in the synthesis) since\\nwhat was to be represented here was not how the intuition is formed from a\\nmanifold within it but only how the existence of the conditioned object\\ncorresponding to it was to be added to the existence of the condition (added\\nin the understanding, as connected with it), and there it was permitted to place\\nin the intelligible world the unconditioned for the altogether conditioned in\\nthe sensible world (with regard to the causality as well as to the contingent\\nexistence of things themselves), although this unconditioned otherwise\\nremained indeterminate, and permitted to make the synthesis transcendent;\\nhence it was also found in the Dialectic of pure speculative reason that the two\\nseemingly opposed ways of\\nﬁ\\nnding the unconditioned for the conditioned\\n–\\nin\\nthe synthesis of causality, for example, to think for the conditioned in the\\nseries of causes and effects of the sensible world a causality that is not further\\nsensibly conditioned\\n–\\ndid not in fact contradict each other, and that the same\\naction which, as belonging to the sensible world, is always sensibly\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n84conditioned\\n–\\nthat is, mechanically necessary\\n–\\ncan at the same time, as\\nbelonging to the causality of an acting being so far as it belongs to the\\nintelligible world, have as its basis a sensibly unconditioned causality and so\\nbe thought as free. Then, the only point at issue was whether this\\ncan\\nbe\\nchanged into\\nis\\n, that is, whether one could show in an actual case, as it were by\\na fact, that certain actions presuppose such a causality (intellectual, sensibly\\nunconditioned causality), whether such actions are actual or only commanded,\\nthat is, objectively practically necessary. We could not hope to meet with\\n5:105\\nthis\\nconnection in actions actually given in experience as events of the sensible\\nworld, since causality through freedom must always be sought outside the\\nsensible world in the intelligible world. But other things, things outside the\\nsensible world, are not given to perception and observation. Hence nothing\\nremained but that there might be found an incontestable and indeed an\\nobjective principle of causality that excludes all sensible conditions from its\\ndetermination, that is, a principle in which reason does not call upon some-\\nthing\\nelse\\nas the determining ground with respect to its causality but already\\nitself contains this determining ground by that principle, and in which it is\\ntherefore as\\npure reason\\nitself practical. Now, this principle does not need to be\\nsearched for or devised; it has long been present in the reason of all human\\nbeings and incorporated in their being, and is the principle of\\nmorality\\n.\\nTherefore, that unconditioned causality and the capacity for it, freedom,\\nand with it a being (I myself) that belongs to the sensible world but at the\\nsame time to the intelligible world, is not merely\\nthought\\nindeterminately and\\nproblematically (speculative reason could already\\nﬁ\\nnd this feasible) but is even\\ndetermined with respect to the law\\nof its causality and\\ncognized\\nassertorically; and\\nthus the reality of the intelligible world is given to us, and indeed as\\ndetermined\\nfrom a practical perspective, and this determination, which for theoretical\\npurposes would be\\ntranscendent\\n(extravagant), is for practical purposes\\nimma-\\nnent\\n. We could not, however, take a similar step with respect to the second\\ndynamical idea, namely that of a\\nnecessary being\\n. We could not rise to it from\\nthe sensible world without the mediation of the\\nﬁ\\nrst dynamical idea. For, if we\\nwanted to attempt it we would have had to venture the leap of leaving all that is\\ngiven to us and bounding into that of which nothing is given to us by which we\\ncould mediate the connection of such an intelligible being with the sensible\\nworld (because the necessary being is to be cognized as given\\noutside us\\n); on the\\nother hand this is quite possible, as is now clear, with respect to\\nour own\\nsubject inasmuch as we cognize ourselves\\non the one side\\nas intelligible beings\\ndetermined by the moral law (by virtue of freedom), and\\non the other side\\nas\\nactive in the sensible world in accordance with this determination. The\\nconcept of freedom alone allows us to\\nﬁ\\nnd the unconditioned and intelligible\\nfor the conditioned and sensible without going outside ourselves. For, it is our\\nreason itself which by means of\\n5:106\\nthe supreme and unconditional practical law\\ncognizes itself and the being that is conscious of this law (our own person) as\\nbelonging to the pure world of understanding and even determines the way in\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n85which, as such, it can be active. In this way it can be understood why in the\\nentire faculty of reason\\nonly the practical\\ncan provide us with the means for\\ngoing beyond the sensible world and provide cognitions of a supersensible\\norder and connection, which, however, just because of this can be extended\\nonly so far as is directly necessary for pure practical purposes.\\nOn this occasion permit me to call attention to one thing, namely, that\\nevery step one takes with pure reason, even in the practical\\nﬁ\\neld where one\\ndoes not take subtle speculation into consideration, nevertheless\\nﬁ\\nts with all\\nthe moments\\nw\\nof the\\nCritique\\nof theoretical reason as closely, and indeed of\\nitself, as if each step had been thought out with deliberate foresight merely to\\nprovide this con\\nﬁ\\nrmation. Such a precise agreement\\n–\\nin no way sought but\\noffering itself (as anyone can convince himself if he will only carry moral\\nconsiderations up to their principles)\\n–\\nof the most important propositions of\\npractical reason with the remarks of the\\nCritique\\nof speculative reason, which\\noften seemed overly subtle and unnecessary, occasions surprise and astonish-\\nment, and strengthens the maxim already cognized and praised by others: in\\nevery scienti\\nﬁ\\nc investigation to pursue one\\n’\\ns way with all possible exactness\\nand candor, to pay no heed to offense that might be given outside its\\nﬁ\\neld but,\\nas far as one can, to carry it through truly and completely by itself. Frequent\\nobservation has convinced me that when such an undertaking has been carried\\nthrough to its end, that which, halfway through it, seemed to me at times very\\ndubious in view of other, extraneous doctrines was at the end found to\\nharmonize perfectly, in an unexpected way, with what had been discovered\\nindependently, without the least regard for those doctrines and without any\\npartiality or prejudice for them, provided I left this dubiousness out of sight\\nfor a while and attended only to the business at hand until I had brought it to\\ncompletion.

Since, howe\\nver,\\nall concepts of things must be referred to intuitions which, for us human b\\neings\\ncannot be other than sensible and hence do not let objects be cognized as things\\nin themselves but only as appearances, in whose series of the conditioned\\nand conditions the unconditioned can never be found, an unavoidable illusion\\nx\\narises from the application of this rational idea of the totality of condition\\ns\\n(and so of the unconditioned) to appearances as if they were things in themselves\\n(for, in the absence of a warning critique they are always held to be such), an\\nillusion which, however, would never be noticed as deceptive if it were no\\nt\\nrevealed by a\\ncon\\nﬂ\\nict\\nof reason with itself in the application to appearance\\nof its basic principle of presupposing the unconditioned for everything co\\nndi-\\ntioned. By this, however, reason is forced to investigate this illusion\\n–\\nwhence\\nit arises and how it can be removed\\n–\\nand this can be done only through a\\ncomplete critical examination of the whole pure faculty of reason; thus the\\nantinomy of pure reason, which becomes evident in its dialectic, is in fact the\\nmost bene\\nﬁ\\ncial error into which human reason could ever have fallen, inasmuch\\nas it\\nﬁ\\nnally drives us to search for the key to escape from this labyrinth; and whe\\nn\\nthis key is found, it further discovers what we did not seek and yet need, namely\\na view into a higher, immutable order of things in which we already ar\\ne and\\nin which\\n5:108\\nwe can henceforth be directed, by determinate precepts, to carry on our\\nexistence in accordance with the highest vocation of reason.\\nHow that natural dialectic in the speculative use of pure reason is to be\\nresolved and how the error arising from an otherwise natural illusion is to be\\navoided can be found in detail in the\\nCritique\\nof that faculty. But reason\\nin its practical use is no better off. As pure practical reason it likewise\\nseeks the unconditioned for the practically conditioned (which rests on\\ninclinations and natural needs), not indeed as the determining ground of\\nthe will, but even when this is given (in the moral law), it seeks the\\nx\\nSchein\\n87unconditioned totality of the object of pure practical reason, under the name\\nof the\\nhighest good\\n.\\nTo determine this idea practically\\n–\\nthat is, suf\\nﬁ\\nciently for the maxims\\nof our rational conduct\\n–\\nis the\\ndoctrine of wisdom\\n, and this in turn, as a\\nscience, is philosophy\\nin the sense in which the word was understood by the\\nancients, for whom it was a direction to the concept in which the highest\\ngood was to be placed and to the conduct by which it was to be acquired.\\nWe would do well to leave this word in its ancient sense, as a\\ndoctrine of the\\nhighest good\\nso far as reason strives to bring it to\\nscience\\n.F o r ,o nt h eo n e\\nhand, the restrictive condition atta\\nched would suit the Greek expression\\n(which signi\\nﬁ\\nes love of\\nwisdom\\n)w h i l ey e ts u f\\nﬁ\\ncing to embrace under the\\nname of philosophy love of\\nscience\\nand so of all speculative rational cognition\\ninsofar as it is serviceable to reason for that concept as well as for the\\npractical determining gr\\nound, without letting us lose sight of the chief end\\non account of which alone it can be c\\nalled doctrine of wisdom. On the\\no t h e rh a n d ,i tw o u l dd on oh a r mt od i s\\ncourage the self-conceit of some-\\none who ventures to claim the title of philosopher if one holds before him, in\\nthe very de\\nﬁ\\nnition, a standard for self-estimation that would very much\\nlower his pretension. For, to be a\\nteacher of wisdom\\nw o u l dm e a ns o m e t h i n g\\nmore than to be a student who has not yet come so far as to guide himself,\\nand still less to guide others, with assured expectation of so high an end; it\\nwould mean to be a\\nmaster in the knowledge of wisdom\\n, which says more than\\na modest man would himself claim; and philosophy, as well as\\n5:109\\nwisdom,\\nwould itself always remain an ideal, which objectively is represented com-\\npletely only in reason alone, whereas su\\nbjectively, for a person, it is only the\\ngoal of his unceasing endeav\\no r s ;a n dn oo n ew o u l db ej u s t i\\nﬁ\\ned in professing\\nto be in possession of it, so as to assume the name of philosopher, unless\\nhe could also show its infallible effect in his own person as an example (in\\nmastery of himself and the unquestione\\nd interest that he preeminently takes\\nin the general good), which the ancients also required for deserving that\\nhonorable title.\\nWe have only one further preliminary remark\\ny\\nto make with respect to the\\ndialectic of pure practical reason in determining the concept\\nof the highest good\\n(a successful resolution of which would lead us to expect, as with the dialectic o\\nf\\ntheoretical reason, the most bene\\nﬁ\\ncial result, inasmuch as the self-contradictions\\nof pure practical reason, honestly stated and not concealed, force us to under-\\ntake a complete critical examination of its own capacity).\\nThe moral law is the sole determining ground of the pure will. But\\nsince this is merely formal (that is to say, it requires only that the form of a\\nmaxim be universally lawgiving), it abstracts as determining ground from\\nall matter and so from every object of volition. Hence, though the highest\\ny\\nOr\\n“\\nreminder,\\n”\\nErinnerung\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n88good may be the whole\\nobject\\nof a pure practical reason, that is, of a pure will, it\\nis not on that account to be taken as its\\ndetermining ground\\n, and the moral law\\nalone must be viewed as the ground for making the highest good and its\\nrealization or promotion the object. This reminder is important in so delicate a\\ncase as the determination of moral principles, where even the slightest mis-\\ninterpretation corrupts dispositions. For, it will have been seen from the\\nAnalytic that if one assumes any object under the name of a good as a\\ndetermining ground of the will prior to the moral law and then derives from\\nit the supreme practical principle, this would always produce heteronomy and\\nsupplant the moral principle.\\nIt is, however, evident that if th\\ne moral law is already included as\\nsupreme condition in the concept of\\nthe highest good, the highest good is\\nthen not merely\\nobject\\n:t h ec o n c e p to fi ta n dt h er e p r e s e n t a t i o no fi t s\\nexistence as possible by our practi\\ncal reason are at the same time the\\ndetermining ground\\n5:110\\no ft h ep u r ew i l lb e c a u s ei nt h a tc a s et h em o r a ll a w ,\\nalready included and thought in this concept, and no other object, in fact\\ndetermines the will in accordance wi\\nth the principle of autonomy. This\\norder of concepts of the de\\ntermination of the will must not be lost sight of,\\nsince otherwise we misunderstand ou\\nrselves and believe that we are contra-\\ndicting ourselves even where everything stands together in the most perfect\\nharmony.\\nChapter II\\nOn the dialectic of pure reason in determining\\nthe concept of the highest good\\nThe concept of the\\nhighest\\nalready contains an ambiguity\\nz\\nthat, if not\\nattended to, can occasion needless di\\nsputes. The highest can mean either\\nthe supreme (\\nsupremum\\n)o rt h ec o m p l e t e(\\nconsummatum\\n). The\\nﬁ\\nrst is that\\ncondition which is itself uncondition\\ned, that is, not subordinate to any\\nother (\\noriginarium\\n); the second is that whole which is not part of a still\\ngreater whole of the same kind (\\nperfectissimum\\n). That\\nvirtue\\n( a sw o r t h i n e s st o\\nbe happy) is the\\nsupreme condition\\nof whatever can even seem to us desirable\\nand hence of all our pursuit of happiness and that it is therefore the\\nsupreme\\ngood has been proved in the Analytic. But it is not yet, on that account, the\\nwhole and complete good as the object of the faculty of desire of rational\\nﬁ\\nnite beings; for this,\\nhappiness\\nis also required, and that not merely in the\\npartial eyes of a person who makes himself an end but even in the judgment\\nof an impartial reason, which regards a person in the world generally as an\\nend in itself. For, to need happiness, to be also worthy of it, and yet not to\\nz\\nZweideutigkeit\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n89participate in it cannot be consistent with the perfect volition of a rational\\nb e i n gt h a tw o u l da tt h es a m et i m eh a v ea l lp o w e r ,e v e ni fw et h i n ko fs u c ha\\nbeing only for the sake of the experiment. Now, inasmuch as virtue and\\nhappiness together constitute possession of the highest good in a person,\\nand happiness distributed in exact proportion to morality (as the worth of a\\nperson and his worthiness to be happy) constitutes the\\nhighest good\\nof a\\npossible world, the latter means\\n5:111\\nthe whole, the complete good, in which,\\nhowever, virtue as the condition is always the supreme good, since it has no\\nfurther condition above it, whereas happiness is something that, though\\nalways pleasant to the possessor of it\\n, is not of itself absolutely and in all\\nrespects good but always presupposes morally lawful conduct as its\\ncondition.\\nTwo determinations\\nnecessarily\\ncombined in one concept must be con-\\nnected as ground and consequent, and so connected that this\\nunity\\nis consid-\\nered either as\\nanalytic\\n(logical connection) or as synthetic (real\\nconnection\\n), the\\nformer in accordance with the law of identity, the latter in accordance with the\\nlaw of causality. The connection of virtue with happiness can therefore be\\nunderstood in one of two ways: either the endeavor to be virtuous and the\\nrational pursuit of happiness are not two different actions but quite identical,\\nin which case no maxim need be made the ground of the former other than\\nthat which serves for the latter; or else that connection is found in virtue\\n’\\ns\\nproducing happiness as something different from the consciousness of virtue,\\nas a cause produces an effect.\\nOf the ancient Greek schools there were, strictly speaking, only two,\\nwhich in determining the concept of the highest good followed one and\\nthe same method insofar as they did not let virtue and happiness hold as\\ntwo different elements of the highest good and consequently sought the\\nunity of the principle in accordance with the rule of identity; but they\\ndiffered, in turn, in their choice of which of the two was to be the funda-\\nmental concept. The Epicurean said: to be conscious of one\\n’\\ns maxim\\nleading to happiness is virtue; the Stoic said: to be conscious of one\\n’\\ns virtue\\nis happiness. For the\\nﬁ\\nrst,\\nprudence\\nwas equivalent to morality; for the\\nsecond, who chose a higher designation for virtue,\\nmorality\\nalone was true\\nwisdom.\\nOne must regret that the acuteness of these men (whom one must,\\nnevertheless, admire for having in such early times already tried all con-\\nceivable paths of philosophic conquest) was unfortunately applied in\\nsearching out identity between extremely heterogeneous concepts, that of\\nhappiness and that of virtue. But it was in keeping with the dialectical\\nspirit of their times, which sometimes misleads subtle minds even now, to\\nsuppress essential and irreconcilable differences in principle by trying to\\nchange them into disputes about words and so to devise a specious unity\\nof concept under merely different names; and this usually occurs in\\n5:112\\ncases\\nwhere the uni\\nﬁ\\ncation of heterogeneous grounds lies so deep or so high,\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n90or would require so complete a transformation of the doctrines assumed\\nin the rest of the philosophic system, that they are afraid to penetrate\\ndeeply into the real difference and prefer to treat it as a diversity merely in\\nformulae.\\nWhile both schools tried to search out the sameness of the practical\\nprinciples of virtue and happiness, they were not agreed as to how they\\nwould force this identity but separated in\\nﬁ\\nnitely from each other inasmuch\\nas one put its principle on the aesthetic side\\na\\nand the other on the logical\\nside, the former in consciousness of s\\nensible need, the other in the inde-\\npendence of practical reason from al\\nl sensible determining grounds.\\nAccording to the Epicurean the concept of virtue was already present in\\nthe maxim of promoting one\\n’\\ns own happiness; according to the Stoic, on the\\nother hand, the feeling of happiness was already contained in consciousness\\nof one\\n’\\ns virtue. What is contained in another concept, however, is indeed\\nidentical with a part of the concept co\\nntaining it but not identical with the\\nwhole, and two wholes can, moreover, be speci\\nﬁ\\ncally different from each\\nother although they consist of the same material,\\nb\\nif, namely, the two parts\\nare combined into a whole in quite different ways. The Stoic maintained\\nthat virtue is the\\nwhole highest good\\n, and happiness only the consciousness\\nof this possession as belonging to the state of the subject. The Epicurean\\nmaintained that happiness is the\\nwhole highest good\\n, and virtue only the\\nform of the maxim for seeking to obtain it, namely, the rational use of\\nmeans to it.\\nNow, it is clear from the Analytic that the maxims of virtue and those of\\none\\n’\\ns own happiness are quite heterogeneous with respect to their supreme\\npractical principle; and, even though they belong to one highest good, so as\\nto make it possible, yet they are so far from coinciding that they greatly\\nrestrict and infringe upon each other in the same subject. Thus the ques-\\ntion,\\nhow is the highest good practically possible?\\nstill remains an unsolved\\nproblem despite all the\\nattempts at coalition\\nthat have hitherto been made.\\nThe Analytic has, however, shown what it is that makes the problem dif\\nﬁ\\n-\\ncult to solve, namely that happiness and morality are two speci\\nﬁ\\ncally quite\\ndifferent elements\\nof the highest good and that, accordingly, their\\n5:113\\ncombination\\ncannot be cognized\\nanalytically\\n(as if someone who seeks his own happiness\\nshould\\nﬁ\\nnd, by mere resolution\\nc\\nof his concepts, that in so acting he is\\nvirtuous, or as if someone who follows virtue should in the consciousness\\nof such conduct\\nﬁ\\nnd that he is already happy\\nipso facto\\n); it must instead be\\na\\nsynthesis\\nof concepts. But because this combination is cognized as a priori\\n–\\nthus as practically necessary and not as derived from experience\\n–\\nand because\\na\\nästhetischen\\n...\\nSeite\\n, i.e., on the side of feeling. See\\nThe Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n399\\n–\\n403\\n,\\n471\\n).\\nb\\nStoffe\\nc\\nAu\\nﬂ\\nösung\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n91the possibility of the highest good therefore does not rest on any empirical\\nprinciples, it follows that the\\ndeduction\\nof this concept must be\\ntranscendental\\n.\\nIt is a priori (morally) necessary\\nto produce the highest good through the freedom\\nof the will\\n: the condition of its possibility must therefore rest solely on a priori\\ngrounds of cognition.\\nI.\\nTHE ANTINOMY OF PRACTICAL REASON\\nIn the highest good which is practical for us, that is, to be made real through o\\nur\\nwill, virtue and happiness are thought as necessarily combined, so that the one\\ncannot be assumed by pure practical reason without the other also belonging to\\nit. Now, this combination is (like every other) either\\nanalytic\\nor\\nsynthetic\\n. Since,\\nas has already been shown, the given combination cannot be analytic, it must be\\nthought synthetically and, indeed, as the connection of cause and effect, because\\nit concerns a practical good, that is, one that is possible through action.\\nConsequently, either the desire for happiness must be the motive to maxims\\nof virtue or the maxim of virtue must be the ef\\nﬁ\\ncient cause of happiness. The\\nﬁ\\nrst is\\nabsolutely\\nimpossible because (as was proved in the Analytic) maxims that\\nput the determining ground of the will in the desire for one\\n’\\nsh a p p i n e s sa r en o t\\nmoral at all and can be the ground of no virtue. But the second is\\nalso impossible\\nbecause any practical connection of causes and effects in the world, as a\\nresult of\\nthe determination of the will, does not depend upon the moral dispositions of\\nthe will but upon knowledge of the laws of nature and the physical ability to use\\nthem for one\\n’\\ns purposes; consequently, no necessary connection of happiness\\nwith virtue in the world, adequate to the highest good, can be expected fro\\nm the\\nmost meticulous observance of moral laws. Now, since the promotion of\\n5:114\\nthe\\nhighest good, which contains this connection in its concept, is an a priori\\nnecessary object of our will and inseparably bound up with the moral law, the\\nimpossibility of the\\nﬁ\\nrst must also prove the falsity of the second. If, therefore,\\nthe highest good is impossible in accordance with practical rules, then the mor\\nal\\nlaw, which commands us to promote it, must be fantastic and directed to emp\\nty\\nimaginary ends and must therefore in itself be false.\\nII.\\nCRITICAL RESOLUTION\\nd\\nOF THE ANTINOMY OF\\nPRACTICAL REASON\\nIn the antinomy of pure speculative reason there is a similar con\\nﬂ\\nict between\\nnatural necessity and freedom in the causality of events in the world. It was\\nresolved by showing that there is no true con\\nﬂ\\nict if the events and even the\\nd\\nAufhebung\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n92world in which they occur are regarded (and they should also be so regarded)\\nmerely as appearances; for, one and the same acting being as\\nappearance\\n(even\\nto his own inner sense) has a causality in the world of sense that always\\nconforms to the mechanism of nature, but with respect to the same event,\\ninsofar as the acting person regards himself at the same time as\\nnoumenon\\n(as\\npure intelligence, in his existence that cannot be temporally determined), he\\ncan contain a determining ground of that causality in accordance with laws of\\nnature which is itself free from all laws of nature.\\nIt is just the same with the foregoing antinomy of pure practical reason. The\\nﬁ\\nrst of the two propositions, that the endeavor after happiness produces a\\nground for a virtuous disposition, is\\nabsolutely false\\n; but the second, that a\\nvirtuous disposition necessarily produces happiness, is false\\nnot absolutely\\nbut\\nonly insofar as this disposition is regarded as the form of causality in the sensib\\nle\\nworld, and consequently false only if I assume existence in the sensible world to\\nbe the only kind of existence of a rational being; it is thus only\\nconditionally false\\n.\\nBut since I am not only warranted in thinking of my existence also as a\\nnoumenon in a world of\\n5:115\\nthe understanding but even have in the moral law a\\npurely intellectual determining ground of my causality (in the sensible\\nworld), it\\nis not impossible that morality of disposition should have a connection,\\nand\\nindeed a necessary connection,\\ne\\nas cause with happiness as effect in the sensible\\nworld, if not immediately yet mediately (by means of an intelligible author of\\nnature), a connection which, in a nature that is merely an object of the senses\\n,\\ncan never occur except contingently and cannot suf\\nﬁ\\nce for the highest good.\\nThus, despite this seeming con\\nﬂ\\nict of a practical reason with itself, the\\nhighest good is the necessary highest end of a morally determined will and is a\\ntrue object of that will; for it is practically possible, and the maxims of such a\\nwill, which refer to it as regards their matter, have objective reality, which at\\nﬁ\\nrst was threatened by that antinomy in the combination of morality with\\nhappiness in accordance with a universal law, but only from a misinterpreta-\\ntion, because the relation between appearances was held to be a relation of\\nthings in themselves to those appearances.\\nWhen we\\nﬁ\\nnd ourselves compelled to go so far, namely to the connection\\nwith an intelligible world, to seek the possibility of the highest good\\nwhich reason points out to all rational beings as the goal of all their moral\\nwishes, it must seem strange that philosophers both of ancient and modern\\ntimes could nevertheless have found happiness in precise proportion to\\nvirtue already in\\nthis life\\n(in the sensible world), or persuaded themselves\\nthat they were conscious of it. For, Epicurus as well as the Stoics extolled\\nabove all the happiness that arises from consciousness of living virtuously;\\nand the former was not so base in his practical precepts as one might infer from\\nthe principles of his theory, which he used for explanation and not for action, or\\ne\\neinen\\n...\\nZusammenhang\\n...\\nhabe\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n93as they were interpreted by many who were misled by his use of the expression\\n“\\npleasure\\n”\\nf\\nfor\\n“\\ncontentment\\n”\\n;\\ng\\non the contrary, he reckoned the most disin-\\nterested practice of the good among the ways of enjoying the most intimate\\ndelight\\nh\\nand included in his scheme of pleasure\\ni\\n(by which he meant a constantly\\ncheerful heart)\\nj\\nsuch moderation and control of the inclinations as the strictest\\nmoral philosopher might require; his chief divergence from the Stoics consisted\\nonly in his placing the motive in this pleasure, which they quite rightly refused\\nto do. For, on the one hand, the virtuous Epicurus\\n–\\nlike many morally\\n5:116\\nwell-\\ndisposed men of this day who nevertheless do not re\\nﬂ\\nect deeply enough on their\\nprinciples\\n–\\nfell into the error of presupposing the virtuous\\ndisposition\\nin the\\npersons for whom he wanted\\nﬁ\\nrst of all to provide the incentive to virtue (and in\\nfact an upright man cannot be happy if he is not\\nﬁ\\nrst conscious of his upright-\\nness; for, with such a disposition, the censure that his own cast of mind would\\nforce him to bring against himself in case of a transgression, and his moral self-\\ncondemnation would deprive him of all enjoyment of the agreeableness that his\\nstate might otherwise contain). But the question is, how is such a disposition an\\nd\\ncast of mind in estimating the worth of one\\n’\\ns existence possible in the\\nﬁ\\nrst place,\\nsince prior to this no feeling at all for moral worth as such would be found in the\\nsubject? If a human being is virtuous he will certainly not enjoy life unless he is\\nconscious of his uprightness in every action, however fortune may favor him in\\nthe physical state of life; but in order to make him virtuous in the\\nﬁ\\nr s tp l a c e ,a n d\\nso before he esteems the moral worth of his existence so highly, can one\\ncommend to him the peace of mind that would arise from consciousness of an\\nuprightness for which he as yet has no sense?\\nBut on the other hand, there is always present here the ground of an error\\nof subreption (\\nvitium subreptionis\\n) and, as it were, of an optical illusion in the\\nself-consciousness of what one\\ndoes\\nas distinguished from what one\\nfeels\\n–\\nan\\nillusion that even the most practiced cannot altogether avoid. The moral\\ndisposition is necessarily connected with consciousness of the determination\\nof the will\\ndirectly by the law\\n. Now, consciousness of a determination of the\\nfaculty of desire is always the ground of a satisfaction\\nk\\nin the action produced\\nby it; but this pleasure, this satisfaction with oneself, is not the determining\\nground of the action: instead, the determination of the will directly by reason\\nalone is the ground of the feeling of pleasure, and this remains a pure practical,\\nnot aesthetic, determination of the faculty of desire. Now, since this determi-\\nnation has exactly the same inward effect, that of an impulse to activity, as a\\nfeeling of the agreeableness expected from the desired action would have\\nf\\nWollust\\ng\\nZufriedenheit\\n. See\\nGroundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n4\\n:\\n393\\nnote v) and\\nThe Metaphysics of\\nMorals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n375\\n).\\nh\\nmit zu den Genußarten der innigste Freude\\ni\\nVergnügens\\nj\\nCompare\\nThe Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n485\\n).\\nk\\nWohlgefallens\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n94produced, we easily\\n5:117\\nlook upon what we ourselves do as something that we\\nmerely passively feel and take the moral incentive for a sensible impulse, just\\nas always happens in so-called illusion of the senses (in this case, inner sense).\\nIt is something very sublime in human nature to be determined to actions\\ndirectly by a pure rational law, and even the illusion that takes the subjective\\nside of this intellectual determinability of the will as something aesthetic and\\nthe effect of a special sensible feeling (for an intellectual feeling would be a\\ncontradiction) is sublime. It is also of great importance to take notice of this\\nproperty of our personality and to cultivate as much as possible the effect of\\nreason on this feeling. But one must also be on guard against demeaning and\\ndeforming the real and genuine incentive, the law itself\\n–\\nas it were, by means\\nof a false foil\\n–\\nby such spurious praise of the moral determining ground as\\nincentive as would base it on feelings of particular joys (which are nevertheless\\nonly results). Respect, and not the grati\\nﬁ\\ncation or enjoyment of happiness, is\\nthus something for which there can be no feeling\\nantecedent\\nto reason and\\nunderlying it (for this would always be aesthetic and pathological): respect as\\nconsciousness of direct necessitation of the will by the law is hardly an\\nanalogue of the feeling of pleasure, although in relation to the faculty of desire\\nit does the same thing but from different sources; only by this way of\\nrepresenting things, however, can one attain what one seeks, namely that\\nactions be done not merely in conformity with duty (as a result of pleasant\\nfeelings) but from duty, which must be the true end of all moral cultivation.\\nHave we not, however, a word that does not denote enjoyment, as the word\\nhappiness does, but that nevertheless indicates a satisfaction with one\\n’\\ns\\nexistence, an analogue of happiness that must necessarily accompany con-\\nsciousness of virtue? Yes! This word is\\ncontentment with oneself\\n,\\nl\\nwhich in its\\nstrict meaning always designates only a negative satisfaction with one\\n’\\ns exis-\\ntence, in which one is conscious of needing nothing. Freedom, and the\\nconsciousness of freedom as an ability to follow the moral law with an\\nunyielding disposition, is\\nindependence from the inclinations\\n, at least as motives\\ndetermining (even if not as\\naffecting\\n) our desire, and so far as I am conscious of\\nthis freedom in following my moral maxims, it is the sole source of an\\nunchangeable contentment, necessarily combined with it\\n5:118\\nand resting on no\\nspecial feeling, and this can be called intellectual contentment. Aesthetic\\ncontentment (improperly so called), which rests on satisfaction of the inclina-\\ntions, however re\\nﬁ\\nned they may be made out to be, can never be adequate to\\nwhat is thought about contentment. For the inclinations change, grow with\\nthe indulgence one allows them, and always leave behind a still greater void\\nthan one had thought to\\nﬁ\\nll. Hence they are always\\nburdensome\\nto a rational\\nbeing, and though he cannot lay them aside, they wrest from him the wish to\\nbe rid of them. Even an inclination to what conforms with duty (e.g., to\\nl\\nSelbstzufriedenheit\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n95bene\\nﬁ\\ncence) can indeed greatly facilitate the effectiveness of\\nmoral\\nmaxims but\\ncannot produce any. For in these everything must be directed to the repre-\\nsentation of the law as determining ground if the action is to contain not\\nmerely\\nlegality\\nbut also\\nmorality\\n. Inclination is blind and servile, whether it is\\nkindly or not; and when morality is in question, reason must not play the part\\nof mere guardian to inclination but, disregarding it altogether, must attend\\nsolely to its own interest as pure practical reason. Even this feeling of\\ncompassion and tender sympathy,\\nm\\nif it precedes consideration of what is\\nduty and becomes the determining ground, is itself burdensome to right-\\nthinking persons, brings their considered maxims into confusion, and pro-\\nduces the wish to be freed from them and subject to lawgiving reason alone.\\nFrom this we can understand how consciousness of this ability of a pure\\npractical reason (virtue)\\nn\\ncan in fact produce consciousness of mastery over one\\n’\\ns\\ninclinations, hence of independence from them and so too from the discontent\\nthat always accompanies them, and thus can produce a negative satisfaction with\\none\\n’\\nss t a t e ,t h a ti s ,\\ncontentment\\n, which in its source is contentment with one\\n’\\ns\\nperson. Freedom itself becomes in this way (namely indirectly) capable of a\\nn\\nenjoyment, which cannot be called happiness because it does not depend upon\\nthe positive concurrence of a feeling; nor is it, strictly speaking,\\nbeatitude\\n,s i n c ei t\\ndoes not include complete independence from inclinations and needs; but it\\nnevertheless resembles the latter, at least insofar as one\\n’\\ns determination of one\\n’\\ns\\nwill can be held free from their in\\nﬂ\\nuence and so, at least in its origin, it is\\nanalogous to the self-suf\\nﬁ\\nciency that can be ascribed only to the supreme being.\\nFrom this resolution of the antinomy of practical pure reason it follows\\n5:119\\nthat\\nin practical principles a natural and necessary connection between the con-\\nsciousness of morality and the expectation of a happiness proportionate to it as\\nits result can at least be thought as possible (though certainly not, on this\\naccount, cognized and understood);\\no\\nthat, on the other hand, principles of the\\npursuit of happiness cannot possibly produce morality; that, accordingly, the\\nsupreme\\ngood (as the\\nﬁ\\nrst condition of the highest good) is morality, whereas\\nhappiness constitutes its second element but in such a way that it is only the\\nmorally conditioned yet necessary result of the former. Only with this sub-\\nordination is the\\nhighest good\\nthe whole object of pure practical reason, which\\nmust necessarily represent it as possible since it commands us to contribute\\neverything possible to its production. But since the possibility of such a\\nconnection of the conditioned with its condition belongs wholly to the super-\\nsensible relation of things and cannot be given in accordance with the laws of\\nthe sensible world, although the practical results of this idea\\n–\\nnamely actions\\nm\\nder Mitleids und der weichherzigen Teilnehmung\\n.

In a narrower practical sense it signi\\nﬁ\\nes the prerogative of the interest\\nof one insofar as the interest of the others is subordinated to it (and it cannot\\nbe inferior to any other). To every faculty of the mind one can attribute an\\ninterest\\n, that is, a principle that contains the condition under which alone\\nits exercise is promoted. Reason, as the\\n5:120\\nfaculty of principles, determines\\nthe interest of all the powers of the mind but itself determines its own. The\\ninterest of its speculative use consists in the\\ncognition\\nof the object up to the\\nhighest a priori principles; that of its practical use consists in the determina-\\ntion of the\\nwill\\nwith respect to the\\nﬁ\\nnal and complete end. That which is\\nrequired for the possibility of any use of reason as such, namely, that its\\nprinciples and af\\nﬁ\\nrmations must not contradict one another, constitutes no\\npart of its interest but is instead the condition of having reason at all; only its\\nextension, not mere consistency with itself, is reckoned as its interest.\\nIf practical reason may not assume and think as given anything further than\\nwhat\\nspeculative\\nreason of itself could offer it from its insight, the latter has\\nprimacy. Supposing, however, that practical reason has of itself original\\na priori principles with which certain theoretical positions are inseparably\\nconnected, while these are withdrawn from any possible insight of speculative\\nreason (although they must not contradict it): then the question is, which\\ninterest is supreme (not, which must give way, for one does not necessarily\\ncon\\nﬂ\\nict with the other)? Whether speculative reason, which knows nothing\\nabout all that which practical reason offers for its acceptance, must accept\\nthese propositions and, although they are transcendent for it, try to unite\\nthem, as a foreign possession handed over to it, with its own concepts, or\\nwhether it is justi\\nﬁ\\ned in obstinately following its own separate interest and, in\\naccordance with the canon of Epicurus, rejecting as empty subtle reasoning\\neverything that cannot accredit its objective reality by manifest examples to be\\nshown in experience, however much it might be interwoven with the interest\\nof the practical (pure) use of reason and in itself not contradict the theoretical,\\nmerely because it actually infringes upon the interest of speculative reason to\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n97the extent that it removes the bounds which the latter has set itself and hands it\\nover to every nonsense or delusion of imagination?\\nIn fact, to the extent that practical reason is taken as dependent upon\\npathological conditions, that is, as merely regulating the inclinations by the\\nsensible principle of happiness, this demand could not be made on speculative\\nreason. Mohammed\\n’\\ns paradise or the fusion with the Deity of the theosophists\\nand mystics would obtrude their monstrosities on reason\\n5:121\\naccording to the\\ntaste\\np\\nof each, and one might as well have no reason at all as surrender it in\\nsuch a way to all sorts of dreams. But if pure reason of itself can be and really is\\npractical, as the consciousness of the moral law proves it to be, it is still only\\none and the same reason which, whether from a theoretical or a practical\\nperspective, judges according to a priori principles; and then it is clear that,\\neven if from the\\nﬁ\\nrst perspective its capacity does not extend to establishing\\ncertain propositions af\\nﬁ\\nrmatively, although they do not contradict it,\\nas soon as\\nthese same propositions belong inseparably to the practical interest\\nof pure reason it\\nmust accept them\\n–\\nindeed as something offered to it from another source,\\nwhich has not grown on its own land but yet is suf\\nﬁ\\nciently authenticated\\n–\\nand\\ntry to compare and connect them with everything that it has within its power\\nas speculative reason, being mindful, however, that these are not its insights\\nbut are yet extensions of its use from another, namely a practical perspective;\\nand this is not in the least opposed to its interest, which consists in the\\nrestriction of speculative mischief.\\nThus, in the union of pure speculative with pure practical reason in one\\ncognition,\\nq\\nthe latter has primacy, assuming that this union is not\\ncontingent\\nand discretionary but based a priori on reason itself and therefore\\nnecessary\\n.\\nFor, without this subordination a con\\nﬂ\\nict of reason with itself would arise,\\nsince if they were merely juxtaposed (coordinate), the\\nﬁ\\nrst would of itself close\\nits boundaries strictly and admit nothing from the latter into its domain, while\\nthe latter would extend its boundaries over everything and, when its need\\nrequired, would try to include the former within them. But one cannot require\\npure practical reason to be subordinate to speculative reason and so reverse the\\norder, since all interest is ultimately practical and even that of speculative\\nreason is only conditional and is complete in practical use alone.\\n5 : 122\\nIV.\\nTHE IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL AS A\\nPOSTULATE OF PURE PRACTICAL REASON\\nThe production of the highest good in the world is the necessary object of a\\nwill determinable by the moral law. But in such a will the\\ncomplete conformity\\nr\\np\\nSinn\\nq\\nVerbindung\\n...\\nzu einem Erkenntnisse\\nr\\nOr\\n“\\nﬁ\\ntness,\\n”\\nAngemessenheit\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n98of dispositions with the moral law is the supreme condition of the highest\\ngood. This conformity must therefore be just as possible as its object is, since it\\nis contained in the same command to promote the object. Complete con-\\nformity of the will with the moral law is, however,\\nholiness\\n, a perfection of\\nwhich no rational being of the sensible world is capable at any moment\\ns\\nof his\\nexistence. Since it is nevertheless required as practically necessary, it can only\\nbe found in an\\nendless progress\\nt\\ntoward that complete conformity, and in\\naccordance with principles of pure practical reason it is necessary to assume\\nsuch a practical progress as the real object of our will.\\nThis endless progress is, however, possible only on the presupposition of\\nthe\\nexistence\\nand personality of the same rational being continuing\\nendlessly\\n(which is called the immortality of the soul). Hence the highest good is\\npractically possible only on the presupposition of the immortality of the\\nsoul, so that this, as inseparably connected with the moral law, is a\\npostulate\\nof pure practical reason (by which I understand a\\ntheoretical\\nproposition,\\nthough one not demonstrable as such, insofar as it is attached inseparably to\\nan a priori unconditionally valid\\npractical\\nlaw).\\nThe proposition about the moral vocation of our nature, that only in an\\nendless progress can we attain complete conformity with the moral law, is of\\nthe greatest usefulness, not merely in regard to the present supplement to the\\nincapacity of speculative reason but also with respect to religion. In default of\\nit, one either quite degrades the moral law from its\\nholiness\\nby making it out to\\nbe\\nlenient\\n(indulgent) and thus conformed to our convenience, or else strains\\nones\\n’\\ns calling as well as ones\\n’\\ns expectation to an unattainable vocation, namely\\nto a hoped-for full acquisition of holiness of will, and so gets lost in enthusi-\\nastic\\ntheosophical\\ndreams that quite\\n5:123\\ncontradict self-knowledge;\\nu\\nin both cases,\\nconstant\\neffort\\nto observe precisely and fully a strict and in\\nﬂ\\nexible command of\\nreason, which is yet not ideal but true, is only hindered. For a rational but\\nﬁ\\nnite being only endless progress from lower to higher stages of moral\\nperfection is possible.\\nThe eternal being\\nv\\nto whom the temporal condition is\\nnothing, sees in what is to us an endless series the whole of conformity with the\\nmoral law, and the holiness that his command in\\nﬂ\\nexibly requires in order to be\\ncommensurable with his justice in the share he determines for each in the\\nhighest good is to be found whole in a single intellectual intuition of the\\nexistence of rational beings. All that a creature can have with respect to hope\\nfor this share is consciousness of his tried disposition, so that, from the\\nprogress he has already made from the worse to the morally better and from\\nthe immutable resolution he has thereby come to know, he may hope for a\\nfurther uninterrupted continuance of this progress, however long his\\ns\\nZeitpunkte\\nt\\nOr\\n“\\na progress to in\\nﬁ\\nnity,\\n”\\nins Unendliche gehend\\nu\\nSelbsterkenntniss\\nv\\nOr\\n“\\nThe In\\nﬁ\\nnite Being,\\n”\\nDer Unendliche\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n99existence may last, even beyond this life;* and thus he cannot hope, either here\\nor in any foreseeable future moment of his existence, to be fully adequate to\\nGod\\n’\\ns will (without indulgence or dispensation, which do not harmonize with\\njustice); he can hope to be so only in the endlessness of\\n5:124\\nhis duration (which\\nGod alone can survey).\\nV.\\nTHE EXISTENCE OF GOD AS A POSTULATE\\nOF PURE PRACTICAL REASON\\nIn the preceding analysis the moral law led to a practical task that is set by pure\\nreason alone and without the aid of any sensible incentives, namely that of the\\nnecessary completeness of the\\nﬁ\\nrst and principal part of the highest good,\\nmorality;\\nand, since this can be fully accomplished only in an eternity, it led\\nto the postulate of\\nimmortality\\n. The same law must also lead to the possibility\\nof the second element of the highest good, namely\\nhappiness\\nproportioned to\\nthat morality, and must do so as disinterestedly as before, solely from impartial\\nreason; in other words, it must lead to the supposition of the existence of a\\ncause adequate to this effect, that is, it must postulate the\\nexistence of God\\nas\\nbelonging necessarily to the possibility of the highest good (which object of\\nour will is necessarily connected with the moral lawgiving of pure reason). We\\nshall present this connection in a convincing manner.\\nHappiness\\nis the state of a rational being in the world in the whole of whose\\nexistence\\neverything goes according to his wish and will\\n, and rests, therefore, on the\\nharmony of nature with his whole end as well as with the essential determining\\nground of his will. Now, the moral law as a law of freedom commands through\\ndetermining grounds that are to be quite independent of nature and of its\\nharmony with our faculty of desire (as incentives); the acting rational being in\\nthe world is, however, not also the cause of the world and of nature itself.\\nConsequently, there is not the least ground in the moral law for a necessary\\nconnection\\nw\\nbetween the morality and the proportionate happiness of a\\n* Conviction of the immutability of one\\n’\\ns disposition in progress toward the good seems, never-\\ntheless, to be in itself impossible for a creature. Because of this the Chris\\ntian religious doctrine has it\\ncome only from the same spirit that works sancti\\nﬁ\\ncation, i.e., this\\nﬁ\\nrm resolution and with it\\nconsciousness of steadfastness in moral progress. But even in a natural way,\\nsomeone who is aware\\nof having persisted through a long portion of his life up to its end in progres\\ns to the better, and this\\nfrom genuine moral motives, may very well have the comforting hope, though not cer\\ntitude, that\\neven in an existence continuing beyond this life he will persevere in these\\nprinciples; and although he\\nis never justi\\nﬁ\\ned here in his own eyes, and can never hope to be justi\\nﬁ\\ned even given the future\\nincrease of natural perfection to which he looks forward\\n–\\nbut with it of his duties as well\\n–\\nnevertheless in this progress which, though it has to do with a goal endless\\nly postponed, yet holds\\nfor God as possession, he can have a prospect of a future of\\nbeatitude;\\nfor this is the expression that\\nreason employs to designate complete\\nwell-being\\nindependent of all contingent causes in the world,\\nwhich, like\\nholiness\\n, is an idea that can be contained only in an endless progress and its totality, an\\nd\\nhence is never fully attained by a creature.\\nw\\nZusammenhang\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n100being belonging to the world as part of it and hence dependent upon\\nit, who for that reason cannot by his will be a cause of this nature and,\\nas far as his happiness is concerned, cannot by his own powers make it\\nharmonize thoroughly with his practical\\n5:125\\nprinciples. Nevertheless, in the\\npractical task of pure reason, that is, in the necessary pursuit of the\\nhighest good, such a connection i\\ns postulated as necessary: we\\nought\\nto\\nstrive to promote the highest good (\\nwhich must therefore be possible).\\nAccordingly, the existence of a cause of all nature, distinct from nature,\\nwhich contains the ground of this connection, namely of the exact\\ncorrespondence of happiness with morality, is also\\npostulated\\n.H o w e v e r ,\\nthis supreme cause is to contain the ground of the correspondence of\\nnature not merely with a law of the will of rational beings but with the\\nrepresentation of this\\nlaw\\n, so far as they make it the\\nsupreme determining\\nground of the will\\n, and consequently not merel\\ny with morals in their form\\nbut also with their morality as thei\\nr determining ground, that is, with\\ntheir moral disposition. Therefore, the highest good in the world is\\npossible only insofar as a supreme cause of nature having a causality in\\nkeeping with the moral disposition\\nis assumed. Now, a being capable of\\nactions in accordance with the representation of laws is\\nan intelligence\\n(a\\nrational being), and the causality of such a being in accordance with this\\nrepresentation of laws is his\\nwill\\n. Therefore the supreme cause of nature,\\ninsofar as it must be presupposed for the highest good, is a being that is\\nthe cause of nature by\\nunderstanding\\nand\\nwill\\n(hence its author), that is,\\nGod\\n. Consequently, the postulate of the possibility of the\\nhighest derived\\ngood\\n(the best world) is likewise the postulate of the reality of a\\nhighest\\noriginal good\\n, namely of the existence of God. Now, it was a duty for us to\\npromote the highest good; hence there is in us not merely the warrant but\\nalso the necessity, as a need conne\\ncted with duty, to presuppose the\\npossibility of this highest good, wh\\nich, since it is possible only under\\nthe condition of the existence of Go\\nd, connects the presupposition of the\\nexistence of God inseparably with dut\\ny; that is, it is morally necessary to\\nassume the existence of God.\\nIt is well to note here that this moral necessity\\nis subjective\\n, that is, a need,\\nand not\\nobjective\\n, that is, itself a duty; for, there can be no duty to assume the\\nexistence of anything (since this concerns only the theoretical use of\\nreason). Moreover, it is not to be understood by this that it is necessary to\\nassume the existence of God\\nas a ground of all obligation in general\\n(for this\\nrests, as has been suf\\nﬁ\\nciently shown, solely on the\\n5:126\\nautonomy of reason\\nitself). What belongs to duty here is only the striving to produce and promote\\nthe highest good in the world, the possibility of which can therefore be\\npostulated, while our reason\\nﬁ\\nnds this thinkable only on the presupposition\\nof a supreme intelligence; to assume the existence of this supreme\\nintelligence is thus connected with the consciousness of our duty, although\\nthis assumption itself belongs to theoretical reason; with respect to theoretical\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n101reason alone, as a ground of explanation, it can be called a\\nhypothesis\\n; but\\nin relation to the intelligibility of an object given us by the moral law (the\\nhighest good), and consequently of a need for practical purposes, it can be\\ncalled\\nbelief\\nx\\nand, indeed, a pure\\nrational belief\\nsince pure reason alone\\n(in its theoretical as well as in its practical use) is the source from which\\nit springs.\\nFrom this\\ndeduction\\nit now becomes comprehensible why the\\nGreek\\nschools\\ncould never solve their problem of the practical possibility of the highest good: it\\nwas because they made the rule of the use which the human will makes of its\\nfreedom the sole and suf\\nﬁ\\ncient ground of this possibility, without, as it seemed\\nto them, needing the existence of God for it. They were indeed correct in\\nestablishing the principle of morals by itself, independently of this postulate and\\nsolely from the relation of reason to the will, so that they made it the\\nsupreme\\npractical condition of the highest good; but this principle was not on this\\naccount the\\nwhole\\ncondition of its possibility. The Epicureans had indeed\\nassumed an altogether false principle of morals as supreme, namely that of\\nhappiness, and had substituted for a law a maxim of each choosing as he please\\nd\\naccording to his inclination;\\ny\\nthey proceeded, however,\\nconsistently\\nenough in\\nthis by demeaning their highest good in the same way, namely in proportion to\\nthe meanness of their principle, and expecting no greater happiness than can be\\nacquired by human prudence (including temperance and moderation of the\\ninclinations), which,\\nz\\nas we know, has to be paltry enough and turn out very\\ndifferently according to circumstances, not to mention the exceptions which\\ntheir maxims had to constantly admit and which made them un\\nﬁ\\ntf o rl a w s .T h e\\nStoics, on the contrary, had chosen their supreme practical principle quite\\ncorrectly, namely virtue, as the condition of the highest good; but inasmuch\\nas they represented the degree of virtue\\n5:127\\nrequired by its pure law as fully\\nattainable in this life, they not only strained the moral capacity of the\\nhuman\\nbeing\\n,u n d e rt h en a m eo fa\\nsage\\n, far beyond all the limits of his nature and\\nassumed something that contradicts all cognition of the human being, but also\\nand above all they would not let the second\\ncomponent\\nof the highest good,\\nnamely happiness, hold as a special object of the human faculty of desire but\\nmade their\\nsage\\n, like a divinity in his consciousness of the excellence of his\\nperson, quite independent of nature (with respect to his own contentment),\\nexposing him indeed to the ills of life but not subjecting him to them (at the\\nsame time representing him as also free from evil); and thus they really left out\\nthe second element of the highest good, namely one\\n’\\ns own happiness, placing it\\nsolely in acting and in contentment with one\\n’\\ns personal worth and so including\\nit in consciousness of one\\n’\\ns moral cast of mind\\n–\\nthough in this they could have\\nbeen suf\\nﬁ\\nciently refuted by the voice of their own nature.\\nx\\nOr\\n“\\nfaith,\\n”\\nGlaube\\ny\\nder beliebigen Wahl nach jedes seiner Neigung\\nz\\nIt is not clear whether\\ndie\\nrefers to\\n“\\nhappiness\\n”\\nor to\\n“\\nprudence.\\n”\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n102The doctrine of Christianity,* even if it is not regarded as a religious\\ndoctrine, gives on this point a concept of the highest good (of the kingdom\\n5:128\\nof\\nGod) which alone satis\\nﬁ\\nes the strictest demand of practical reason. The moral\\nlaw is holy (in\\nﬂ\\nexible) and demands holiness of morals, although all the moral\\nperfection that a human being can attain is still only virtue, that is, a disposit\\nion\\nconformed with law\\nfrom respect\\nfor law, and thus consciousness of a continuing\\npropensity to transgression or at least impurity, that is, an admixture of many\\nspurious (not moral) motives to observe the law, hence a self-esteem combined\\nwith humility; and so, with respect to the holiness that the Christian law\\ndemands, nothing remains for a creature but endless progress, though for that\\nvery reason he is justi\\nﬁ\\ned in hoping for his endless duration. The\\nworth\\nof a\\ndisposition\\ncompletely\\nconformed with the moral law is in\\nﬁ\\nnite, since all possible\\nhappiness in the judgment of a wise and all-powerful distributor of it has no\\nrestriction other than rational beings\\n’\\nlack of conformity with their duty. But the\\nmoral law of itself still does not\\npromise\\nany happiness, since this is not\\nnecessarily connected with observance of the law according to our concepts of\\na natural order as such. The Christian doctrine of morals now supplements this\\nlack (of the second indispensable component of the highest good) by represent-\\ning the world in which rational beings devote themselves with their whole s\\noul\\nto the moral law as a\\nkingdom of God\\n, in which nature and morals come into a\\nharmony, foreign to each of them of itself, through a holy author who make\\ns the\\nderived highest good possible.\\nHoliness\\nof morals is prescribed to them as a\\n5:129\\nrule\\n* It is commonly held that the Christian precept of morals has no advantage\\nwith respect to its purity\\nover the moral concepts of the Stoics; but the difference between them is nonetheles\\ns very obvious.\\nThe Stoic system made consciousness of strength of soul the pivot on which all\\nmoral dispositions\\nwere to turn; and although its disciples spoke of duties and even determined them quite wel\\nl, yet they\\nput the incentive and proper determining ground of the will in an elevation of one\\n’\\ns cast of mind\\nabove the lower incentives of the senses, which have power only through weak\\nness of soul. With\\nthem therefore, virtue was a certain heroism of the\\nsage\\n, who, raising himself above the animal nature\\nof the human being, is suf\\nﬁ\\ncient to himself, and through the discourses on duties to others is himself\\nraised above them and is not subject to any temptation to transgress the moral law.\\nAll this, however,\\nthey could not have done if they had represented this law in all its purity and stri\\nctness, as the precept\\nof the Gospel does. If I understand by an\\nidea\\na perfection to which nothing adequate can be given in\\nexperience, the moral ideas are not, on that account, something transcenden\\nt, that is, something of\\nwhich we cannot even determine the concept suf\\nﬁ\\nciently or of which it is uncertain whether there is\\nany object corresponding to it at all, as is the case with the ideas of specul\\native reason; instead, the\\nmoral ideas, as archetypes of practical perfection, serve as the indispen\\nsable rule of moral conduct\\nand also as the\\nstandard of comparison\\n.N o w ,i fIc o n s i d e r\\nChristian morals\\non their philosophic side,\\nthen, compared with the ideas of the Greek schools they would appear as follows: the\\nideas of the\\nCynics\\n,t h e\\nEpicureans\\n,t h e\\nStoics\\n,a n dt h e\\nChristians\\nare\\nnatural simplicity, prudence, wisdom\\n,a n d\\nholiness\\n. With respect to the path for attaining them, what distinguished the Greek sch\\nools from one\\nanother was that the Cynics found\\ncommon human understanding\\nsuf\\nﬁ\\ncient, the others the path of\\nscience\\nalone; but both found the mere\\nuse of natural powers\\nsuf\\nﬁ\\ncient for it. Christian morals, because\\nit frames its precept so purely and in\\nﬂ\\nexibly (as must be done), deprives the human being of\\ncon\\nﬁ\\ndence that he can be fully adequate to it, at least in this life, but again sets it u\\np by enabling us to\\nhope that if we act as well as is within our\\npower\\n, then what is not within our power will come to our\\naid from another source, whether or not we know in what way. Aristotle and Plato d\\niffered only with\\nrespect to the\\norigin\\nof our moral concepts.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n103even in this life, while the well-being proportioned to it, namely\\nbeatitude\\n,i s\\nrepresented as attainable only in an eternity; for, the\\nformer\\nmust always be the\\narchetype of their conduct in every state, and progress toward it is already\\npossible and necessary in this life, whereas the\\nlatter\\n, under the name of\\nhappiness, cannot be attained at all in this world (so far as our own capacity is\\nconcerned) and is therefore made solely an object of hope. Nevertheless, the\\nChristian principle of\\nmorals\\nitself is not theological (and so heteronomy); it is\\ninstead autonomy of pure practical reason by itself, since it does not make\\ncognition of God and his will the basis of these laws but only of the attainment of\\nthe highest good subject to the condition of observing these laws, and since it\\nplaces even the proper\\nincentive\\nto observing them not in the results wished for\\nbut in the representation of duty alone, faithful observance of which alone\\nconstitutes worthiness to acquire the latter.\\nIn this way the moral law leads through the concept of the highest good,\\nas the object and\\nﬁ\\nnal end of pure practical reason,\\nto religion, that is, to the\\nrecognition\\na\\nof all duties as divine commands, not as sanctions\\n–\\nthat is, chosen\\nand in themselves contingent ordinances of another\\n’\\ns will\\n–\\nbut as essential\\nlaws\\nof every free will in itself, which must nevertheless be regarded as com-\\nmands of the supreme being because only from a will that is morally perfect\\n(holy and bene\\nﬁ\\ncent\\nb\\n) and at the same time all-powerful, and so through\\nharmony with this will, can we hope t\\no attain the highest good, which the\\nmoral law makes it our duty to take as the object of our endeavors. Here\\nagain, then, everything remains disi\\nnterested and grounded only on duty,\\nand there is no need to base it on incentives of fear and hope, which if they\\nbecame principles would destroy th\\ne whole moral worth of actions. The\\nmoral law commands me to make the hi\\nghest possible good in a world the\\nﬁ\\nnal object of all my conduct. But I ca\\nnnot hope to produce this except by\\nthe harmony of my will with that of a holy and bene\\nﬁ\\ncent author of the\\nw o r l d ;a n da l t h o u g hi nt h ec o n c e p to ft\\nhe highest good, as that of a whole in\\nwhich the greatest happiness is repre\\nsented as connected in the most exact\\n5:130\\nproportion with the greatest degree o\\nfm o r a lp e r f e c t i o n\\n(possible in crea-\\ntures),\\nmy own happiness\\nis included, this is neverth\\neless not the determining\\nground of the will that is directed to promote the highest good; it is instead\\nthe moral law (which, on the contrar\\ny, limits by strict conditions my\\nunbounded craving for happiness).\\nFor this reason, again, morals\\nc\\nis not properly the doctrine of how we are to\\nmake\\nourselves happy but of how we are to become\\nworthy\\nof happiness. Only\\nif religion is added to it does there also enter the hope of some day participat-\\ning in happiness to the degree that we have been intent upon not being\\nunworthy of it.\\na\\nErkenntnis\\nb\\ngütigen\\nc\\nOr\\n“\\nmoral philosophy,\\n”\\ndie Moral\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n104Someone is\\nworthy\\nof possessing a thing or a state when it harmonizes\\nwith the highest good that he is in possession of it. It can now be readily seen\\nthat all worthiness depends upon moral conduct, since in the concept of the\\nhighest good this constitutes the condition of the rest (which belongs to\\none\\n’\\ns state), namely, of one\\n’\\ns share of happiness. Now, from this it follows\\nthat\\nmorals\\nin itself must neve\\nrb et r e a t e da sa\\ndoctrine of happiness\\n,t h a ti s ,a s\\ninstruction in how to become happy;\\nfor morals has to do solely with the\\nrational condition (\\nconditio sine qua non\\n) of happiness and not with the means\\nof acquiring it. But when morals (which merely imposes duties and does not\\nprovide rules for sel\\nﬁ\\nsh wishes) has been set forth completely, then\\n–\\nafter\\nthe moral wish, based on a law, to promote the highest good (to bring the\\nkingdom of God to us) has been awakened, which could not previously have\\narisen in any sel\\nﬁ\\nsh soul, and for the sake of this wish the step to religion has\\nbeen taken\\n–\\nthen for the\\nﬁ\\nrst time can this ethical doctrine also be called a\\ndoctrine of happiness, because\\nit is only with religion that the\\nhope\\nof\\nhappiness\\nﬁ\\nrst arises.\\nFrom this it can also be seen that if one asks about\\nGod\\n’\\ns\\nﬁ\\nnal end\\nin creating\\nthe world, one must not name the\\nhappiness\\nof the rational beings in it but\\nthe\\nhighest good\\n, which adds a condition to that wish of such beings, namely the\\ncondition of being worthy of happiness, that is, the\\nmorality\\nof these same\\nrational beings, which condition alone contains the standard in accordance\\nwith which they can hope to participate in the former at the hands of a\\nwise\\nauthor. For, since\\nwisdom\\nconsidered theoretically signi\\nﬁ\\nes\\ncognition of the\\nhighest good\\n, and practically\\nthe\\nﬁ\\ntness of the\\n5:131\\nwill for the highest good\\n, one cannot\\nattribute to a highest independent wisdom an end that would be based merely\\non bene\\nﬁ\\ncence.\\nd\\nFor one cannot conceive the effect of this bene\\nﬁ\\ncence (with\\nrespect to the happiness of rational beings) as be\\nﬁ\\ntting the highest original\\ngood except under the limiting conditions of harmony with the\\nholiness\\nof his\\nwill.* Hence those who put the end of creation in the glory\\ne\\nof God (provided\\nthis is not thought anthropomorphically, as inclination to be praised) perhaps\\nhit upon the best expression. For, nothing glori\\nﬁ\\nes God more than what is\\nd\\nGütigkeit\\ne\\nEhre\\n* In passing, and to make what is proper to these concepts distinguisha\\nble, I add only this\\nremark. Although one ascribes to God various attributes the quality of whic\\nh is found appro-\\npriate to creatures as well except that in him they are raised to the highest d\\negree, e.g., power,\\nknowledge, presence, goodness, and so forth, calling them omnipotence, omniscience, o\\nmni-\\npresence, all-goodness, and so forth, there are still three that are ascribed\\nto God exclusively and\\nyet without the addition of greatness, and all of them are moral: he is the\\nonly holy\\n,t h e\\nonly\\nblessed\\n,t h e\\nonly wise\\n, because these concepts already imply the absence of limitation. Accordin\\ng\\nto the order of these attributes he is also the\\nholy lawgiver\\n(and creator), the\\nbene\\nﬁ\\ncent governor\\n(and preserver), and the\\njust judge\\n–\\nthree attributes which include everything by which God is\\nthe object of religion and in conformity with which the metaphysical pe\\nrfections are added of\\nthemselves in reason.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n105most estimable in the world, respect for his command, observance of the holy\\nf\\nduty that his law lays upon us, when there is added to this his magni\\nﬁ\\ncent plan\\nof crowning such a beautiful order with corresponding happiness. If the latter\\n(to speak humanly) makes him worthy of love, by the former he is an object of\\nworship (adoration). Human beings themselves can acquire love by bene\\nﬁ\\n-\\ncence, but by it alone they can never acquire respect, so that the greatest\\nbene\\nﬁ\\ncence procures them honor\\ng\\nonly when it is exercised in accordance\\nwith worthiness.\\nIt now follows of itself that in the order of ends the human being (and with\\nhim every rational being) is an\\nend in itself\\n, that is, can never be used merely as\\na means by anyone (not even by God) without being at the same\\ng\\ntime himself\\nan end, and that humanity in our person must, accordingly, be\\nholy\\nh\\nto\\nourselves: for he is the\\nsubject of the moral law\\nand so of that\\n5:132\\nwhich is holy in\\nitself, on account of which and in agreement with which alone can anything be\\ncalled holy.

These postulates are not theoretical dogmas\\nbut\\npresuppositions\\nhaving a necessarily practical reference\\ni\\nand thus, although they\\ndo not indeed extend speculative cognition, they give objective reality to the\\nideas of speculative reason in\\ngeneral\\n(by means of their reference to what is\\npractical) and justify its holding concepts even the possibility of which it could\\nnot otherwise presume to af\\nﬁ\\nrm.\\nThese postulates are those of\\nimmortality\\n,o f\\nfreedom\\nconsidered posi-\\ntively (as the causality of a being ins\\nofar as it belongs to the intelligible\\nworld), and of the\\nexistence of God\\n.T h e\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nﬂ\\nows from the practically\\nnecessary condition of a duration be\\nﬁ\\ntting the complete ful\\nﬁ\\nl l m e n to ft h e\\nmoral law; the\\nsecond\\nfrom the necessary presupposition of independence\\nfrom the sensible world and of the capacity to determine one\\n’\\ns will by the law\\nof an intelligible world, that is, the law of freedom; the\\nthird\\nfrom the\\nnecessity of the condition for such an\\nintelligible world to be the highest\\nf\\nOr\\n“\\nsacred,\\n”\\nheiligen\\ng\\nihnen\\n...\\nEhre macht\\n, perhaps\\n“\\ndoes them honor\\n”\\nh\\nOr\\n“\\nsacred,\\n”\\nheilig\\ni\\nin notwendig praktischer Rucksicht\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n106good, through the presupposition of th\\ne highest independent good, that is,\\nof the existence of God.\\nAiming at the highest good, made nece\\nssary by respect for the moral law,\\nand the presupposition\\nﬂ\\nowing from this of its objective reality lead through\\nthe postulates of practical reason to co\\nncepts that speculative reason could\\nindeed present as problems but could never solve.

In order to extend a pure cognition\\npractically\\nt h e r em u s tb ea\\npurpose\\ngiven a priori, that is, an end as object (of\\nthe will) that, independently of all theo\\nretical principles, is represented as\\npractically necessary by an imperativ\\ne determining the will immediately (a\\ncategorical imperative), and in this case that is the\\nhighest good\\n.T h i s ,\\nhowever, is not possible without pres\\nupposing three theoretical concepts\\n(for which, because they are only pure\\nrational concepts, no corresponding\\nintuition can be found and consequentl\\ny, by the theoretical path, no objec-\\ntive reality): namely, freedom, immort\\nality, and God. Thus by the practical\\nlaw that commands the existence of the highest good possible in a world, the\\npossibility of those objects of pure spe\\nculative reason, the objective reality\\nwhich the latter could not assure them, i\\ns postulated; by this the theoretical\\ncognition of pure reason certainly rece\\nives an increment, but it consists only\\nin this: that those concepts, otherwise problematic (merely thinkable) for it,\\nare now declared\\nk\\nassertorically to be concepts\\nto which real objects belong,\\nbecause practical reason unavoidably r\\nequires the existence of them for the\\npossibility of its object, the highes\\nt good, which is absolutely necessary\\npractically, and theoretical reason is thereby justi\\nﬁ\\ned in assuming them.\\nBut this extension of theoretical reaso\\nn is no extension of speculation, that\\nis, no positive use can now be made of it for\\ntheoretical purposes\\n.F o r ,s i n c e\\nnothing further is accomplished in thi\\ns by practical reason than that those\\nconcepts are real and really have thei\\nr (possible) objects, but nothing is\\nthereby given us by way of intuition of them (which can also not be\\ndemanded), no synthetic proposition is possible by this reality granted\\nthem. Hence this disclosure does not help us in the least for speculative\\npurposes, although with respect to the\\npractical use of pure reason it does\\n5:135\\nhelp us to extend this cognition of ours.\\nl\\nThe above three ideas of spec-\\nulative reason are in themselves still no\\nt cognitions; nevertheless they are\\n(transcendent)\\nthoughts\\nin which there is nothing impossible. Now they\\nreceive objective reality through an\\napodictic practical law, as necessary\\nconditions of the possibility of what it commands us\\nto make an object\\n,t h a ti s ,\\nwe are instructed by it\\nthat they have objects\\n, although we are not able to show\\nhow their concept refers to an object, and this is not yet cognition\\nof these\\nk\\nerklärt werden\\nl\\nIt is not clear from the text whether the phrase\\nzur Erweiterung dieses unseres Erkenntnisses\\nshould\\nbe placed here or after\\nin speculativer Absicht\\n.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n108objects\\n; for one cannot thereby judge synthetically about them at all or\\ndetermine their application theoretic\\nally; hence one can make no theoretical\\nrational use\\nm\\nof them at all, in which use all speculative cognition of reason\\nproperly consists. Nevertheless, theoretical cognition,\\nnot indeed of these\\nobjects\\nbut of reason in general, is extended by this insofar as\\nobjects were\\ngiven\\nto those ideas by the practical postul\\nates, a merely problematic thought\\nhaving by this means\\nﬁ\\nrst received objective reali\\nty. There was therefore no\\nextension of the cognition\\nof given supersensible objects\\n,b u tt h e r ew a sn e v e r -\\ntheless an extension of theoretical reason and of its cognition with respect to\\nthe supersensible in general, inasmu\\nch as theoretical reason was forced to\\ngrant\\nthat there are such objects\\n, though it cannot determine them more closely\\nand so cannot itself extend this cognition of the objects (which have now been\\ngiven to it on practical grounds and, moreover, only for practical use); for this\\nincrement, then, pure theoretical reason, for which all those ideas are tran-\\nscendent and without objects, has to thank its practical capacity only. In this\\nthey become\\nimmanent\\nand\\nconstitutive\\ninasmuch as they are grounds of the\\npossibility of\\nmaking real the necessary object\\nof pure practical reason (the highest\\ngood), whereas apart from this they are\\ntranscendent\\nand merely\\nregulative\\nprinciples of speculative reason, which do not require it to assume a new obje\\nct\\nbeyond experience but only to bring its use in experience nearer to complete-\\nness. But when once reason is in possession of this increment, it will, as\\nspeculative reason, go to work with these ideas in a negative way (really, only\\nto secure its practical use), that is, not extending but purifying, so as on one\\nside\\nto ward off\\nanthropomorphism\\nas the source of\\nsuperstition\\nor specious\\n5:136\\nextension\\nof those concepts by supposed experience, and on the other side\\nfanaticism\\n,\\nwhich promises such an extension by means of supersensible intuition or\\nfeelings\\n–\\nall of which are hindrances to the practical use of pure reason, so\\nthat the removal of them certainly belongs to an extension of our cognition for\\npractical purposes, without contradicting the admission that for speculative\\npurposes reason has not in the least gained by this.\\nEvery use of reason with respect to an object requires pure concepts of the\\nunderstanding (\\ncategories\\n), without which no object can be thought. These can\\nbe applied for the theoretical use of reason, that is, for cognition of that kind,\\nonly insofar as intuition (which is always sensible) is also put under them, and\\ntherefore merely in order to represent by means of them an object of possible\\nexperience. But here\\nideas\\nof reason, which cannot be given in any experience\\nat all, are what I would have to think by means of categories in order to cognize\\nan object. Here, however, our concern with these ideas is not for the sake of\\ntheoretical cognition of their objects but only with whether they have objects\\nat all. Pure practical reason provides this reality, and theoretical reason has\\nnothing further to do in this than merely\\nto think\\nthose objects through\\nm\\nkeinen theoretischen Gebrauch der Vernunft machen\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n109categories, and this, as we have elsewhere clearly shown, can be done quite\\nwell without needing intuition (whether sensible or supersensible) because the\\ncategories have their seat and origin in the pure understanding solely as the\\nfaculty of thinking, independently of and prior to any intuition, and they\\nalways signify only an object in general,\\nin whatever way it may be given to us\\n.\\nNow, insofar as the categories are to be applied to these ideas, it is not possible\\nto give them any object in intuition; but\\nthat an object really exists\\n, so that a\\ncategory as a mere form of thought is here not empty but has signi\\nﬁ\\ncance, is\\nsuf\\nﬁ\\nciently assured them by an object that practical reason presents beyond\\ndoubt in the concept of the highest good, namely the\\nreality of the concepts\\nthat\\nare required for the possibility of the highest good, without, however, effect-\\ning by this increment the least extension of cognition in accordance with\\ntheoretical principles.\\n5:137\\nIf these ideas of God, of an intelligible world (the kingdom of God), and of\\nimmortality are determined more closely by predicates drawn from our own\\nnature, this determination cannot be regarded as either a\\nsensualizing\\nn\\nof those\\npure rational ideas (anthropomorphism) or as a transcendent cognition of\\nsupersensible\\nobjects; for these predicates are no others than understanding and\\nwill, considered moreover in the relation to each other in which they must be\\nthought in the moral law, and hence only to the extent that a pure practical use\\nis made of them. As for all the rest that is added to these concepts psycholog-\\nically\\n–\\nthat is, insofar as we observe these faculties of ours empirically\\nin their\\nexercise\\n(for example, that human understanding is discursive so that its\\nrepresentations are not intuitions but thoughts, that these follow one another\\nin time, that the human will is always dependent for its satisfaction upon the\\nexistence of its object, and so forth, which cannot be the case in the supreme\\nbeing)\\n–\\nthis is abstracted from in that case, and then what remains of the\\nconcepts by which we think of a pure intelligence\\no\\nis nothing more than what\\nis required for the possibility of thinking of a moral law; thus there is indeed a\\ncognition of God but only with practical reference, and if we attempt to extend\\nit to a theoretical cognition we\\nﬁ\\nnd an understanding that does not think but\\nintuits\\n, a will that is directed to objects upon the existence of which its\\nsatisfaction does not in the least depend (not to mention the transcendental\\npredicates, as, e.g., a magnitude of existence, i.e., duration, which, however, is\\nnot in time, the only possible means we have of representing existence as\\nmagnitude). All of these are attributes of which we can form no concept\\nﬁ\\nt for\\ncognition\\nof the object, and we learn from this that they can never be used for a\\ntheory\\nof supersensible beings, so that on this side they are quite unable to\\nground a speculative cognition and their use is, instead, limited solely to the\\npractice of the moral law.\\nn\\nVersinnlichung\\no\\nVerstandeswesen\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n110This last is so obvious, and can be proved so clearly by fact, that one can\\ncon\\nﬁ\\ndently challenge all supposed\\nnatural theologians\\np\\n(a singular name)* to\\ncite (over and above the merely ontological predicates) even one property, say\\nof the understanding or the will, determining this object\\n5:138\\nof theirs, of which it\\ncould not be shown incontestably that if everything anthropomorphic is\\nseparated from it nothing would remain to us but the mere word, without\\nour being able to combine with it the least concept by which we could hope for\\nan extension of theoretical cognition. But with respect to the practical there\\nstill remains to us, of the properties of understanding and will, the concept of a\\nrelation to which the practical law (which precisely determines a priori this\\nrelation of the understanding to the will) furnishes objective reality. Once this\\nis done, reality is given to the concept of the object of a morally determined\\nwill (that of the highest good) and with it to the conditions of its possibility, the\\nideas of God, freedom, and immortality, but always only with reference to the\\npractice of the moral law (not for any speculative purpose).\\nAfter these reminders\\ns\\nit is now easy to\\nﬁ\\nnd the answer to the important\\nquestion:\\nwhether the concept of God is a concept belonging to physics\\n(and\\ntherefore also to the metaphysics, which only contains the pure a priori\\nprinciples of the former in their universal meaning)\\nor to morals\\n. If, in order\\nto\\nexplain\\nthe arrangements of nature or their changes, one has recourse to\\nGod as the author of all things, this is at least no physical explanation and is a\\ncomplete confession that one has come to an end of one\\n’\\ns philosophy; for, one\\nis forced to assume something of which in itself one otherwise has no concept,\\nin order to be able to frame a concept of the possibility of what one sees before\\none\\n’\\ns eyes. But it is impossible through metaphysics to proceed\\nby sure\\ninferences\\nfrom knowledge of this world to the concept of God and to the\\nproof of his existence, for this reason: that in order to say that this world was\\npossible only through a\\nGod\\n(as we must think this concept) we would have to\\ncognize this world as the most perfect whole possible and, in order to do so,\\ncognize all possible worlds as well (so as to be able to compare them with this\\none), and would\\n5:139\\ntherefore have to be omniscient. Finally\\nt\\nhowever, it is\\nabsolutely impossible to cognize the existence of this being from mere con-\\ncepts, because every existential proposition\\n–\\nthat is, every proposition that\\np\\nGottesgelehrten\\ns\\nOr\\n“\\nAccording to these remarks,\\n”\\nNach diesen Erinnerungen\\nt\\nVollends\\n, perhaps\\n“\\nto cognize completely\\n”\\n*\\nLearning\\nq\\nis, strictly speaking, only the sum total of the\\nhistorical\\nsciences. Consequently only\\nthe teacher of revealed theology can be called a theologian. If, however, one wants to call someone\\nwho is in possession of the rational sciences (mathematics and philosophy)\\nlearned\\n, even though\\nthis could con\\nﬂ\\nict with the meaning of the word (which always counts as learning only that which\\nmust be\\ntaught\\nr\\nand which, therefore, one cannot of oneself discover by reason), the philosopher,\\nwith his cognition of God as a positive science, would cut too poor a\\nﬁ\\ngure to let himself be called\\non that account a\\nlearned\\nman.\\nq\\nGelehrsamkeit\\nr\\ngelehrt\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n111says, of a being of which I frame a concept, that it exists\\n–\\nis a synthetic\\nproposition, that is, one by which I go beyond that concept and say more\\nabout it than was thought in the concept, namely, that to this concept\\nin the\\nunderstanding\\nthere corresponds an object\\noutside the understanding\\n, which it is\\nabsolutely impossible to elicit by any inference. Thus there remains for reason\\nonly one single procedure by which to arrive at this cognition, namely, as pure\\nreason to start from the supreme principle of its pure practical use (inasmuch as\\nthis is always directed simply to the\\nexistence\\nof something as a result of reason)\\nand determine its object. And then, in its unavoidable problem, namely that of\\nthe necessary direction of the will to the highest good, there is shown not only\\nthe necessity of assuming such an original being in relation to the possibility of\\nthis good in the world but\\n–\\nwhat is most remarkable\\n–\\nsomething that was quite\\nlacking in the progress of reason on the path of nature,\\na precisely determined\\nconcept of this original being\\n. Since we can know only a small part of this world\\nand can still less compare it with all possible worlds, we can well infer from its\\norder, purposiveness, and magnitude a\\nwise\\n,\\nbene\\nﬁ\\ncent\\n,\\npowerful\\n, and so forth\\nauthor of it, but not his\\nomniscience\\n,\\nall-bene\\nﬁ\\ncence, omnipotence\\n, and so forth. It\\nmay even very well be granted that one is authorized\\nu\\nto supplement this\\nunavoidable defect by a permitted, quite reasonable hypothesis, namely, that\\nwhen wisdom, bene\\nﬁ\\ncence, and so forth are displayed in all the parts that offer\\nthemselves to our closer cognition, it is just the same in all the rest, and t\\nhat it\\nwould therefore be reasonable to ascribe all possible perfection to the author of\\nthe world; but these are not\\ninferences\\nin which we can pride ourselves on our\\ninsight, but only liberties\\nv\\nwhich can be overlooked but still need further\\nrecommendation before we can make use of them. Thus the concept of God\\nalways remains, on the path of empirical inquiry (physics), a concept of the\\nperfection of the\\nﬁ\\nrst being not determined precisely enough to be held\\nadequate to the concept of a deity (but with metaphysics in its transcendental\\npart nothing at all is to be accomplished).\\n5:140\\nWhen I now try to bring this concept into relation with the object of practical\\nreason, I\\nﬁ\\nnd that the moral principle admits it as possible only on the\\npresupposition of an author of the world possessed of the\\nhighest perfection\\n.\\nHe must be\\nomniscient\\nin order to cognize my conduct even to my inmost\\ndisposition in all possible cases and throughout the future,\\nomnipotent\\nin order to\\nbestow results appropriate to it, and so too\\nomnipresent\\n,\\neternal\\n,a n ds of o r t h .\\nThus the moral law, by means of the concept of the highest good as the object of\\na pure practical reason, determines the concept of the original being as the\\nsupreme being\\n, something that the physical (and, pursued higher, the metaphys-\\nical) and so the whole speculative course of reason could not effect. The concept\\nof God, then, is one belonging originally not to physics, that is, to speculative\\nu\\nbefugt\\nv\\nBefugnisse\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n112reason, but to morals, and the same can be said of the other concepts of reason\\nwhich we treated above as postulates of reason in its practical use.\\nIf in the history of Greek philosophy we\\nﬁ\\nnd no clear traces of a pure\\nrational theology earlier than Anaxagoras, the reason is not that the older\\nphilosophers had not enough understanding or insight to raise themselves to it\\nby the path of speculation, at least with the aid of a quite reasonable hypoth-\\nesis; what could have been easier, what more natural, than the thought that\\noccurs of itself to everyone, to assume a single rational cause of the world\\nhaving\\nall perfection\\nin place of indeterminate degrees of perfection of several\\ncauses? But the ills in the world seemed to them to be much too important\\nobjections to consider themselves justi\\nﬁ\\ned in such a hypothesis. Thus they\\nshowed understanding and insight precisely in not permitting themselves this\\nhypothesis and instead looked about among natural causes to see if they could\\nnot\\nﬁ\\nnd among them the character\\nw\\nand capacity required for original beings.\\nBut once this acute people had advanced so far in their investigations as to\\ntreat philosophically even moral objects, about which other peoples had never\\ndone more than prate, they then\\nﬁ\\nrst found a new need, namely a practical\\none, which did not fail to give them the determined concept of the original\\nbeing; and in this speculative reason had the role of a spectator, or at best had\\nthe merit of embellishing a concept that had not grown on its own land and of\\nfurthering, by a train of con\\nﬁ\\nrmations from the study of nature which now\\ncame forward for the\\nﬁ\\nrst time,\\n5:141\\nnot indeed its authority (which was already\\nestablished) but only its display, with a supposed theoretical insight of reason.\\nBy these reminders the readers of the\\nCritique\\nof pure speculative reason will\\nbe perfectly convinced how extremely necessary, how salutary for theology and\\nmorals that laborious\\ndeduction\\nof the categories was. For, if they are placed in\\nthe pure understanding it is only by this deduction that we can be prevented\\nfrom taking them, with Plato, to be innate and basing on them extravagant\\npretensions and theories of the supersensible to which we can see no end,\\nthereby making theology a magic lantern of chimeras; but if they are taken to be\\nacquired, this deduction prevents us from restricting, with Epicurus, all and\\nevery use of them, even for practical purposes, merely to objects and determin-\\ning grounds of the senses. But now that the\\nCritique\\nhas shown by that\\ndeduction,\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nthat they are not of empirical origin but have their seat and\\nsource a priori in the pure understanding, and\\nsecond\\nthat, since they are\\nreferred\\nto objects in general\\nindependently of intuition of these objects, they\\nindeed bring about\\ntheoretical cognition\\nonly in application to\\nempirical\\nobjects\\nbut still, applied to an object given by pure practical reason, also serve for a\\ndetermined thought of the supersensible\\n, yet only to the extent that this is deter-\\nmined merely through such predicates as necessarily belong to the pure\\npractical\\nw\\nBeschaffenheit\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n113purpose\\ngiven a priori and to its possibility. Speculative restriction of pur\\ne reason\\nand its practical extension\\nﬁ\\nrst bring it into that\\nrelation of equality\\nin which\\nreason in general can be used purposively, and this example shows better than\\nany other that the path\\nto wisdom\\n, if it is to be assured and not impassible or\\nmisleading, must for us human beings unavoidably pass through science; but it\\nis not till science is completed that we can be convinced that it leads to that go\\nal.\\n5 : 142\\nVIII.\\nON ASSENT\\nx\\nFROM A NEED OF PURE REASON\\nA need of pure reason in its speculative use leads only to hypotheses, that of\\npure practical reason, however, to postulates; for in the\\nﬁ\\nrst case I ascend\\nfrom the derived as high\\nas I will\\nin the series of grounds and do not need an\\noriginal ground\\ny\\nin order to give objective reality to what is derived (e.g., to\\nthe causal connection of things and changes in the world), but only in order to\\nsatisfy completely my inquiring reason with respect to it. Thus I see before me\\norder and purposiveness in nature, and need not proceed to speculation in\\norder to assure myself of their\\nreality\\n; instead, it is only in order\\nto explain\\nthem that I need\\nto presuppose a Deity\\nas their cause; but, since an inference\\nfrom an effect to a determined cause, especially to a cause so precise and so\\ncompletely determined as we have to think in God, is always uncertain and\\ndoubtful, such a presupposition cannot be brought further than the degree of\\nbeing the most reasonable opinion for us human beings.* On the other hand, a\\nneed\\nof pure practical\\nreason is based on a\\nduty\\n, that of making something (the\\nhighest good) the object of my will so as to promote it with all my powers; and\\nthus I must suppose its possibility and so too the conditions for this, namely\\nGod, freedom, and immortality, because I cannot prove these by my spec-\\nulative reason, although I can also not refute them. This duty is based on\\nsomething that is indeed quite independent of these suppositions and of itself\\napodictically certain, namely the moral law; and so far it needs no further\\n5:143\\nsupport by theoretical opinions as to the inner character of things, the secret\\naim of the order of the world,\\nz\\nor a ruler presiding over it, in order to bind us\\nmost perfectly to actions unconditionally conformed to the law. But the\\nsubjective effect of this law, namely the disposition conformed with it and\\nalso made necessary by it to promote the practically possible highest good,\\nx\\nFürwahrhalten\\n, literally\\n“\\nholding to be true\\n”\\ny\\nUrgrund\\nz\\nAbzweckung der Weltordnung\\n* But even here we could not allege a need\\nof reason\\nif we had not before our eyes a problematic\\nbut yet unavoidable concept of reason, namely that of an absolutely necessary being. This concept\\nnow wants to be determined, and this, when the drive toward extension is added, is the objective\\nground of a need of speculative reason, namely, to determine more closely the concept of a\\nnecessary being that is to serve as the original ground of others and so to make this recognizable by\\nsome means. Without such prior necessary problems there are no\\nneeds\\n, at least\\nnot of pure reason\\n;\\nthe rest are needs of inclination.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n114nevertheless presupposes at least that the latter is\\npossible\\n; in the contrary case\\nit would be practically impossible to strive for the object of a concept that\\nwould be, at bottom, empty and without an object. Now, the above-mentioned\\npostulates concern only the physical or metaphysical conditions\\n–\\nin a word,\\nthose which lie in the nature of things\\n–\\nof the\\npossibility\\nof the highest good,\\nnot, however, for the sake of a discretionary speculative purpose but of a\\npractically necessary end of a pure rational will, which does not here\\nchoose\\n;\\ninstead, it\\nobeys\\nan in\\nﬂ\\nexible command of reason that has its ground\\nobjectively\\nin the character of things as they must be appraised universally by pure reason\\nand is not based upon, say,\\ninclination\\n, which is by no means justi\\nﬁ\\ned in at once\\nassuming, for the sake of what we\\nwish\\non merely\\nsubjective\\ngrounds, that the\\nmeans to it are possible or that its object is real. This is, accordingly, a\\nneed\\nfrom an absolutely necessary point of view\\nand justi\\nﬁ\\nes its presupposition not\\nmerely as a permitted hypothesis but as a postulate from a practical point of\\nview; and, granted that the pure moral law in\\nﬂ\\nexibly binds everyone as a\\ncommand (not as a rule of prudence), the upright man may well say: I\\nwill\\nthat\\nthere be a God, that my existence in this world be also an existence in a pure\\nworld of the understanding beyond natural connections, and\\nﬁ\\nnally that my\\nduration be endless; I stand by this, without paying attention to rationaliza-\\ntions, however little I may be able to answer them or to oppose them with\\nothers more plausible, and I will not let this belief be taken from me; for this is\\nthe only case in which my interest, because I\\nmay\\nnot give up anything of it,\\nunavoidably determines my judgment.*\\n∵\\nIn order to prevent misinterpretations in the use of a concept as\\n5:144\\nyet so\\nunusual as that of a pure practical rational belief, I may add one more remark.\\nIt might almost seem as if this rational belief is here announced as itself a\\ncommand\\n, namely to assume the highest good as possible. But a belief that is\\ncommanded is an absurdity. If, however, one recalls from the preceding\\nexplanation what is required to be assumed in the concept of the highest\\ngood, one will become aware that the assumption of this possibility cannot be\\ncommanded, and that no practical disposition requires one to\\ngrant\\nit but that\\n* In the\\nDeutsches Museum\\n, February\\n1787\\n, there is a treatise by a very subtle and clearheaded\\nman, the late Wizenmann,\\n13\\nwhose early death is to be lamented, in which he disputes the\\nauthorization to conclude from a need to the objective reality of its object and illustrates the\\npoint by the example of a\\nman in love\\n, who, having fooled himself into an idea of beauty that is\\nmerely a chimera of his own brain, would like to conclude that such an object really exists\\nsomewhere. I grant that he is perfectly correct in this, in all cases where the need is based upon\\ninclination\\n, which cannot necessarily postulate the existence of its object even for the one affected\\nby it, much less can it contain a requirement valid for everyone, and therefore it is a\\nmerely\\nsubjective\\nground of the wish. But in the present case it is a\\nneed of reason\\narising from an\\nobjective\\ndetermining ground of the will, namely the moral law, which necessarily binds every rational being\\nand therefore justi\\nﬁ\\nes him a priori in presupposing in nature the conditions be\\nﬁ\\ntting it and makes\\nthe latter inseparable from the complete practical use of reason. It is a duty to realize the highest\\ngood to the utmost of our capacity; therefore it must be possible; hence it is also unavoidable for\\nevery rational being in the world to assume what is necessary for its objective possibility. The\\nassumption is as necessary as the moral law, in relation to which alone it is valid.\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n115speculative reason must concede it without being asked, since no one can want\\nto maintain that a worthiness of rational beings in the world to be happy in\\nconformity with the moral law combined with a possession of this happiness\\nproportioned to it is\\nimpossible\\nin itself. Now, with respect to the\\nﬁ\\nrst element\\nof the highest good, namely that which concerns morality, the moral law gives\\nmerely a command, and to doubt that possibility of that component would be\\ntantamount to calling in question the moral law itself. But as for what concerns\\nthe second part of that object, namely happiness in thorough conformity with\\nthat worthiness, there is no need of a command to grant its possibility in\\ngeneral, since theoretical reason has nothing to say against it; but\\nthe\\n5:145\\nway\\nin\\nwhich\\nwe\\nare to think such a harmony of the laws of nature with those of\\nfreedom has in it something with respect to which we have a\\nchoice\\n, since\\ntheoretical reason decides nothing with apodictic certainty about it, and with\\nrespect to this there can be a moral interest which turns the scale.\\nI said above that in accordance with a mere course of nature in the world\\nhappiness in exact conformity with moral worth is not to be expected and is to\\nbe held impossible, and that therefore the possibility of the highest good on\\nthis side can be granted only on the presupposition of a moral author of the\\nworld. I deliberately postponed the restricting of this judgment to the sub-\\njective conditions of our reason so as not to make use of it until the manner of\\nits assent had been determined more closely. In fact, the impossibility referred\\nto is\\nmerely subjective\\n, that is, our reason\\nﬁ\\nnds it\\nimpossible for it\\nto conceive, in\\nthe mere course of nature, a connection so exactly proportioned and so\\nthoroughly purposive\\na\\nbetween events occurring in the world in accordance\\nwith such different laws, although, as with everything else in nature that is\\npurposive, it nevertheless cannot prove\\n–\\nthat is, set forth suf\\nﬁ\\nciently on\\nobjective grounds\\n–\\nthe impossibility of it in accordance with universal laws of\\nnature.\\nNow, however, a deciding ground of a different kind comes into play so as\\nto turn the scale in this irresolution of speculative reason. The command to\\npromote the highest good is based objectively (in practical reason); its possi-\\nbility in general is likewise objectively based (in theoretical reason, which has\\nnothing against it). But as for the way we are to represent this possibility,\\nwhether in accordance with universal laws of nature without a wise author\\npresiding over nature or only on the supposition of such an author, reason\\ncannot decide this objectively. Now a\\nsubjective\\ncondition of reason enters into\\nthis, the only way in which it is theoretically possible for it to think the exact\\nharmony of the realm\\nb\\nof nature with the realm of morals as the condition of\\nthe possibility of the highest good, and at the same time the only way that is\\nconducive to morality (which is subject to an\\nobjective\\nlaw of reason). Now,\\nsince the promotion of the highest good, and therefore the supposition of its\\na\\nzweckmäßig\\nb\\nReichs\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n116possibility, is\\nobjectively\\nnecessary (though only as a consequence of practical\\nreason), while at the same time the manner, the way in which we would think it\\nas possible rests with our choice, in which a free interest of pure practical\\nreason decides\\n5:146\\nfor the assumption of a wise author of the world, it follows that\\nthe principle that determines our judgment about it, though it is\\nsubjective\\nas a\\nneed, is yet, as the means of promoting what is\\nobjectively\\n(practically)\\nnecessary, the ground of a maxim of assent for moral purposes, that is,\\na\\npure practical rational belief\\n. This, then, is not commanded but\\n–\\nbeing a\\nvoluntary\\nc\\ndetermination of our judgment, conducive to the moral (com-\\nmanded) purpose and moreover harmonizing with the theoretical need of\\nreason to assume that existence and to make it the basis of the further use of\\nreason\\n–\\nit has itself arisen from the moral disposition; it can therefore often\\nwaver even in the well-disposed but can never fall into unbelief.\\nIX.\\nON THE WISE ADAPTATION OF THE HUMAN\\nBEING\\n’\\nS COGNITIVE FACULTIES TO HIS\\nPRACTICAL VOCATION\\nIf human nature is called to strive for the highest good, it must also be assumed\\nthat the measure of its cognitive faculties, especially their relation to one\\nanother, is suitable to this end. Now, the\\nCritique\\nof pure\\nspeculative\\nreason\\nproves its utter insuf\\nﬁ\\nciency for solving, conformably with this end, the most\\nimportant problems that are proposed to it, although the\\nCritique\\ndoes not fail\\nto recognize the natural hints of this same reason, which are not to be over-\\nlooked, nor the great steps that it can take to approach this great goal that is set\\nbefore it, which, however, it can never reach of itself, even with the aid of the\\ngreatest cognition of nature. Nature then seems here to have provided for us\\nonly in a\\nstepmotherly\\nfashion with the faculty needed for our end.\\nAssuming now that nature had here complied with our wish and given us\\nthat capacity for insight or that enlightenment\\nd\\nwhich we would like to possess\\nor which some believe erroneously they actually do possess, what would, as far\\nas we can tell, be the result of it? Unless our whole nature were at the same\\ntime changed, the\\ninclinations\\n, which always have the\\nﬁ\\nrst\\n5:147\\nword, would\\nﬁ\\nrst\\ndemand their satisfaction and, combined with reasonable re\\nﬂ\\nection, their\\ngreatest possible and most lasting satisfaction under the name of\\nhappiness\\n;\\nthe moral law would afterward speak, in order to keep them within their\\nproper limits and even to subject them all to a higher end which has no regard\\nto inclination. But instead of the con\\nﬂ\\nict that the moral disposition now has to\\ncarry on with the inclinations, in which, though after some defeats, moral\\nstrength of soul is to be gradually acquired,\\nGod and eternity with their awful\\nc\\nfreiwillig\\nd\\nErleuchtung\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n117majesty\\nwould stand unceasingly\\nbefore our eyes\\n(for what we can prove\\nperfectly holds as much certainty for us as what we are assured of by our\\nsight). Transgression of the law would, no doubt, be avoided: what is com-\\nmanded would be done; but because the\\ndisposition\\nfrom which actions ought\\nto be done cannot be instilled by any command, and because the spur to\\nactivity in this case would be promptly at hand and\\nexternal\\n, reason would\\nhave no need to work itself up so as to gather strength to resist the inclinations\\nby a lively representation of the dignity of the law: hence most actions\\nconforming to the law would be done from fear, only a few from hope, and\\nnone at all from duty, and the moral worth of actions, on which alone in the\\neyes of supreme wisdom the worth of the person and even that of the world\\ndepends, would not exist at all. As long as human nature remains as it is,\\nhuman conduct would thus be changed into mere mechanism in which, as in a\\npuppet show, everything would\\ngesticulate\\nwell but there would be\\nno life\\nin\\nthe\\nﬁ\\ngures. Now, when it is quite otherwise with us; when with all the effort of\\nour reason we have only a very obscure and ambiguous view into the future;\\nwhen the governor of the world allows us only to conjecture his existence and\\nhis grandeur, not to behold them or prove them clearly; when, on the other\\nhand, the moral law within us, without promising or threatening anything\\nwith certainty, demands of us disinterested respect; and when,\\nﬁ\\nnally, this\\nrespect alone, become active and ruling,\\nﬁ\\nrst allows us a view into the realm\\nof the supersensible, though only with weak glances; then there can be a\\ntruly moral disposition, devoted immediately to the moral law, and a rational\\ncreature can become worthy of the highest good in conformity with the moral\\nworth of his person and not merely\\n5:148\\nwith his actions. Thus what the study of\\nnature and of the human being teaches us suf\\nﬁ\\nciently elsewhere may well be\\ntrue here also: that the inscrutable wisdom by which we exist is not less worthy\\nof veneration in what it has denied us than in what it has granted us.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n118The\\ndoctrine of the method\\nof pure\\npractical\\nreason cannot be understood as\\n5:151\\nthe\\nway to proceed (in re\\nﬂ\\nection as well as in exposition) with pure practical\\nprinciples with a view to scienti\\nﬁ\\nc\\ncognition\\nof them, which alone is properly\\ncalled method elsewhere, in the\\ntheoretical\\n(for popular cognition needs a\\nmanner\\ne\\nbut science a\\nmethod\\n, i.e., a procedure\\nin accordance with principles\\nof\\nreason by which alone the manifold of a cognition can become a\\nsystem\\n). Here\\nthe doctrine of method is understood, instead, as the way in which one can\\nprovide the laws of pure practical reason with\\naccess\\nto the human mind and\\nin\\nﬂ\\nuence\\non its maxims, that is, the way in which one can make objectively\\npractical reason\\nsubjectively\\npractical as well.\\nIt is now clear that those determining grounds of the will which alone\\nmake maxims properly moral and give them a moral worth\\n–\\nthe immediate\\nrepresentation of the law and the obje\\nctively necessary observance of it as\\nduty\\n–\\nmust be represented as the proper incentives to action, since other-\\nwise\\nlegality\\nof actions would be produced but not\\nmorality\\nof dispositions.\\nBut it is not so clear, and on the contrary must at\\nﬁ\\nrst glance seem to\\neveryone quite improbable, that even subjectively that presentation of\\np u r ev i r t u ec a nh a v e\\nmore power\\nover the human mind and can provide a\\nfar stronger incentive to effect even th\\nat legality of actions and to bring forth\\nstronger resolutions to prefer the la\\nw to every other consideration, from\\npure respect for it, than all the deceptive allurement\\nf\\nof enjoyment and, in\\ngeneral, everything that\\nmay be counted as happiness, or even all threats of\\npain and troubles can produce. But it is really so, and if human\\n5:152\\nnature were\\nnot so constituted, no way of represen\\nting the law by circumlocutions and\\nby means recommending it\\ng\\nwould ever bring forth mor\\nality of disposition.\\nEverything would be sheer hypocr\\nisy; the law would be hated or even\\ndespised, though still observed for the sake of one\\n’\\ns own advantage. The\\nletter of the law (legality) would be found in our actions, but the spirit of it in\\nour dispositions (morality) would not be found at all; and since with all our\\nefforts we could not altogether free o\\nurselves from reason in our judgment,\\nwe would unavoidably have to appear\\nworthless, depraved human beings in\\nour own eyes, even if we sought to com\\npensate ourselves for this morti\\nﬁ\\nca-\\ntion before the inner court by enjoying\\nthe pleasure that, in our delusion, we\\nsuppose a natural or divine law has co\\nnnected with the machinery of its\\npolice, guided only by what was done without troubling itself about the\\nm o t i v e sf r o mw h i c hi tw a sd o n e .\\nIt certainly cannot be denied that in order to bring either a mind that is\\nstill uncultivated or one that is degraded onto the track of the morally good\\nin the\\nﬁ\\nrst place, some preparatory guidan\\nce is needed to attract it by means\\nof its own advantage or to alarm it by fear of harm; but as soon as this\\ne\\nArt\\nf\\nAnlockungen aus Vorspiegelungen\\ng\\nemfehlende Mittel\\n121machinery, these leading strings hav\\ne had even some effect, the pure moral\\nmotive must be brought to bear on the soul, the motive which\\n–\\nnot only\\nbecause it is the only one that can ground a character (a consistent practical\\ncast of mind in accordance with uncha\\nngeable maxims) but also because it\\nteaches the human being to feel his own dignity\\n–\\ngives his mind power,\\nunexpected even by himself, to tear himself away from all sensible attach-\\nments so far as they want to rule over him and to\\nﬁ\\nnd a rich compensation for\\nthe sacri\\nﬁ\\nce he makes in the independence of his rational nature and the\\ngreatness of soul to which he sees that he is called. We will therefore show,\\nby observations anyone can make, th\\nat this property of our minds, this\\nreceptivity to a pure moral interest and hence the moving force of the pure\\nrepresentation of virtue, when it is duly brought to bear on the human heart\\nis the most powerful incentive to the good and the only one when an\\nenduring and meticulous observance of\\n5:153\\nmoral maxims is in question. It\\nmust, however, be remembered that if these observations show only the\\nreality of such a feeling but not any moral improvement brought about by it,\\nthis takes nothing away from\\nh\\nthe only method there is for making the\\nobjectively practical laws of pure reason subjectively practical merely\\nthrough the pure representation of duty, as if it were an empty fantasy.\\nFor, since this method has never yet\\nbeen widely practiced experience\\ncan say nothing of its result; instead one can only ask for proofs of the\\nreceptivity to such incentive\\ns, which I will now present brie\\nﬂ\\nya n dt h e n\\nsketch in a few words the method of founding and cultivating genuine moral\\ndispositions.\\nIf one attends to the course of conver\\nsation in mixed companies consist-\\ning not merely of scholars and subtle reasoners but also of business people or\\nwomen, one notices that their entertain\\nment includes, besides storytelling\\nand jesting, arguing; for storytelling, if it is to have novelty and with it\\ninterest, is soon exhausted and jesti\\nng easily becomes insipid. Now, of all\\narguments there are none that more excite the participation of persons who\\nare otherwise soon bored with subtle reasoning and that bring a certain\\nliveliness into the company than arguments about the\\nmoral worth\\nof this or\\nthat action by which the character of some person is to be made out. Those\\nfor whom anything subtle and re\\nﬁ\\nned in theoretical questions is dry and\\ni r k s o m es o o nj o i ni nw h e ni ti saq u e s t i o no fh o wt om a k eo u tt h em o r a l\\nimport of a good or evil action that has been related, and to an extent one\\ndoes not otherwise expect of them on\\nany object of speculation they are\\nprecise, re\\nﬁ\\nned, and subtle in thinking out everything that could lessen or\\neven just make suspect the purity of purpose and consequently the degree of\\nvirtue in it. In these appraisals one can\\noften see revealed the character of the\\nperson himself who judg\\nes others: some, in exercising their judicial of\\nﬁ\\nce\\nh\\nkeinen Abbruch tue\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n122especially upon the dead, seem inclined chie\\nﬂ\\ny to defend the goodness that\\nis related of this or that deed against\\nall injurious charges of impurity and\\nultimately to defend the whole moral worth of the person against the\\nreproach of dissimulation and secret\\nwickedness; others, on the contrary,\\nare more prone to contest this w\\north by accusations and fault-\\nﬁ\\nnding. One\\ncannot always, however, attribute to the latter the\\n5:154\\nintention of arguing away\\nall virtue from examples of human beings in order to make it an empty name:\\noften it is, instead, only well-meant str\\nictness in determining genuine moral\\nimport in accordance with an uncompromising law, comparison with which,\\ninstead of with examples, greatly lowers self-conceit in moral matters, and\\nhumility is not only taught but felt by anyone when he examines himself\\nstrictly. Nevertheless, one can for the\\nmost part see, in those who defend the\\npurity of intention in given examples, that where there is a presumption of\\nuprightness they would like to remov\\ne even the least spot from the deter-\\nmining ground lest, if the truthfulne\\nss of all examples were disputed and the\\npurity of all human virtue denied, hum\\nan virtue might in the end be held a\\nmere phantom, and so all striving toward it would be deprecated as vain\\naffectation and delusive self-conceit.\\nI do not know why educators of young people have not long since made\\nuse of this propensity of reason to enter with pleasure upon even the most\\nsubtle examination of the practical questions put to them and why they have\\nnot, after\\nﬁ\\nrst laying the foundation in a purely moral catechism, searched\\nthrough the biographies of ancient and modern times in order to have at\\nhand instances for the duties present\\ned, in which, especially by comparison\\nof similar actions under different circ\\numstances, they could well activate\\ntheir pupils\\n’\\nappraisal in marking the lesser or greater moral import of such\\nactions; they would\\nﬁ\\nnd that even someone very young, who is not yet ready\\nfor speculation, would soon become very acute and thereby not a little\\ninterested, since he would feel the progress of his faculty of judgment;\\nand, what is most important, they could hope with con\\nﬁ\\ndence that frequent\\npractice in knowing good conduct in all its purity and approving it and, on\\nthe other hand, marking with regret or contempt the least deviation from it,\\neven though it is carried on only as a game of judgment in which children\\ncan compete with one another, yet will\\nleave behind a lasting impression of\\nesteem on the one hand and disgust on the other, which by mere habitu-\\nation,\\ni\\nrepeatedly looking on such actions\\nas deserving approval or censure,\\nwould make a good foundation for uprightness in\\n5:155\\nthe future conduct of life.\\nBut I do wish that educators would spar\\ne their pupils exampl\\nes of so-called\\nnoble\\n(supermeritorious) actions, with\\nwhich our sentimental writings so\\nabound, and would expose them all\\nj\\nonly to duty and to the worth that a\\nhuman being can and must give himself in his own eyes by consciousness of\\ni\\nGewohnheit\\nj\\nalles\\n...\\nauszusetzen\\n, perhaps\\n“\\nrefer everything\\n”\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n123not having transgressed it; for, wh\\natever runs up into empty wishes and\\nlongings for inaccessible perfectio\\nn produces mere heroes of romance who,\\nwhile they pride themselves on their f\\neeling for extravagant greatness,\\nrelease themselves in return from the observance of common and everyday\\nobligation\\nk\\nw h i c ht h e ns e e m st ot h e mi n s i g n i\\nﬁ\\ncant and petty.*\\nBut if one asks: What, then, really is\\npure\\nmorality, by which as a touchstone\\none must test the moral content of every action? I must admit that only\\nphilosophers can make the decision of this question doubtful, for it is long\\nsince decided in common human reason, not indeed by abstract general\\nformulae but by habitual use, like the difference between the right and the\\nleft hand. We will, accordingly,\\nﬁ\\nrst show in an example the mark by which\\npure virtue is tested and, representing it as set before, say, a ten-year-old boy\\nfor his appraisal, see whether he must necessarily judge so of himself, without\\nbeing directed to it by a teacher. One tells him the story of an honest man\\nwhom someone wants to induce to join the calumniators of an innocent but\\notherwise powerless person (say, Anne Boleyn, accused by Henry VIII of\\nEngland). He is offered gain, that is, great gifts or high rank; he rejects them.\\nThis will produce mere approval and applause in\\n5:156\\nthe listener\\n’\\ns soul, because it\\nis gain. Now threats of loss begin. Among these calumniators are his best\\nfriends, who now refuse him their friendship; close relatives, who threaten to\\ndisinherit him (he is not wealthy); powerful people, who can pursue and hurt\\nhim in all places and circumstances; a prince who threatens him with loss of\\nfreedom and even of life itself. But, so that the measure of suffering may be full\\nand he may also feel the pain that only a morally good heart can feel very\\ndeeply, represent his family, threatened with extreme distress and poverty, as\\nimploring him to yield\\nand himself, though upright, yet with a heart not hard or\\ninsensible\\nm\\neither to compassion or to his own distress; represent him at a\\nmoment when he wishes that he had never lived to see the day that exposed\\nhim to such unutterable pain and yet remains\\nﬁ\\nrm in his resolution to be\\ntruthful, without wavering or even doubting; then my young listener will be\\nraised step by step from mere approval to admiration, from that to amazement,\\nand\\nﬁ\\nnally to the greatest veneration and a lively wish that he himself could be\\nsuch a man (though certainly not in such circumstances); and yet virtue is here\\nk\\nSchuldigkeit\\nl\\nAufwallungen\\nm\\ndoch eben nicht von festen, unemp\\nﬁ\\nndlichen Organen das Gefühl\\n* It is quite advisable to praise actions in which a great, unsel\\nﬁ\\nsh, sympathetic disposition or\\nhumanity is manifested. But in this case one must call attention not so much to the\\nelevation of soul\\n,\\nwhich is very\\nﬂ\\neeting and transitory, as to the\\nsubjection of the heart\\nto\\nduty\\n, from which a more\\nlasting impression can be expected, because this brings principles with it (but the former, only\\nebullitions).\\nl\\nOne need only re\\nﬂ\\nect a little and one will always\\nﬁ\\nnd a debt that he has somehow\\nincurred with respect to the human race (even if it were only that, by the inequality of human\\nbeings in the civil constitution, one enjoys advantages on account of which others must all the\\nmore do without), which will prevent the self-complacent image of\\nmerit\\nfrom supplanting the\\nthought of\\nduty\\n.\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n124worth so much only because it costs so much, not because it brings any pro\\nﬁ\\nt.\\nAll the admiration, and even the endeavor to resemble this character, here\\nrests wholly on the purity of the moral principle, which can be clearly\\nrepresented only if one removes from the incentive to action everything that\\npeople may reckon only to happiness. Thus morality must have more power\\nover the human heart the more purely it is presented. From this it follows that\\nif the law of morals and the image of holiness and virtue are to exercise any\\nin\\nﬂ\\nuence at all on our soul, they can do so only insofar as they are laid to heart\\nin their purity as incentives, unmixed with any view to one\\n’\\ns welfare, for it is in\\nsuffering that they show themselves most excellently. But that which, by being\\nremoved strengthens the effect of a moving force, must have been a hindrance.\\nConsequently every admixture of incentives taken from one\\n’\\ns own happiness\\nis a hindrance to providing the moral law with in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the human heart. I\\nmaintain, further, that even in that admired action, if the motive from which it\\nwas done was esteem for one\\n’\\ns duty, then it is\\n5:157\\njust this respect for the law that\\nstraightaway has the greatest force on the mind of a spectator, and not, say, any\\npretension to inner magnanimity and a noble cast of mind; consequently duty,\\nnot merit, must have not only the most determinate in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the mind but,\\nwhen it is represented in the correct light of its inviolability, the most\\npenetrating in\\nﬂ\\nuence as well.\\nIn our times, when one hopes to have more in\\nﬂ\\nuence on the mind through\\nmelting, tender feelings or high-\\nﬂ\\nown, puffed-up pretensions, which make\\nthe heart languid instead of strengthening it, than by a dry and earnest\\nrepresentation of duty, which is more suited to human imperfection and to\\nprogress in goodness, it is more necessary than ever to direct attention to this\\nmethod. It is altogether contrapurposive to set before children, as a model,\\nactions as noble, magnanimous, meritorious, thinking that one can captivate\\nthem by inspiring enthusiasm for such actions. For, since they are still so\\nbackward in observance of the commonest duty and even in correct estimation\\nof it, this is tantamount to soon making them fantasizers. But even with the\\ninstructed and experienced part of humankind this supposed incentive has, if\\nnot a prejudicial effect on the heart, at least no genuine moral one, though this\\nis what one wanted to bring about by means of it.\\nAll\\nfeelings\\n, especially those that are to produce unusual exertions, must\\naccomplish their effect at the moment they are at their height and before they\\ncalm down; otherwise they accomplish nothing because the heart naturally\\nreturns to its natural moderate vital motion and accordingly falls back into the\\nlanguor that was proper to it before, since something was applied that indeed\\nstimulated it but nothing that strengthened it.\\nPrinciples\\nmust be built on\\nconcepts; on any other foundation there can be only seizures, which can give a\\nperson no moral worth and not even con\\nﬁ\\ndence in himself, without which the\\nconsciousness of one\\n’\\ns moral disposition and of a character of this kind, the\\nhighest good in human beings, cannot come to exist. Now, if these concepts\\nare to become subjectively practical they must not stop short with objective\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n125laws of morality, to be admired and esteemed with reference to humanity: the\\nrepresentation of them must be considered in relation to human beings and\\nto the individual human\\n5:158\\nbeing; for then this law appears in a form that, though\\nindeed highly deserving of respect, is not so pleasing as if it belonged to\\nthe element to which he is naturally accustomed but instead as it constrains\\nhim to leave this element, often not without self-denial, and to go to a higher\\nelement in which he can maintain himself only with effort and with unceasing\\napprehension of relapsing. In a word, the moral law demands obedience\\nfrom duty and not from a predilection that cannot and ought not to be\\npresupposed at all.\\nLet us now see in an example whether there is more subjective moving\\nforce as an incentive if an action is represented as a noble and magnanimous\\none than if it is represented merely as duty in relation to the earnest moral law.\\nThe action by which someone tries with extreme danger to his life to rescue\\npeople from a shipwreck,\\nﬁ\\nnally losing his own life in the attempt, will indeed\\nbe reckoned, on one side, as duty but on the other and even for the most part as\\na meritorious action; but our esteem for it will be greatly weakened by the\\nconcept of\\nduty to himself\\n, which seems in this case to suffer some infringe-\\nment. More decisive is someone\\n’\\ns magnanimous sacri\\nﬁ\\nce of his life for the\\npreservation of his country; and yet there still remains some scruple as to\\nwhether it is so perfect a duty to devote oneself to this purpose of one\\n’\\ns own\\naccord and unbidden, and the action has not in itself the full force of a model\\nand impulse to imitation. But if it is an essential\\nn\\nduty, transgression of which\\nviolates the moral law in itself and without regard to human welfare and, as it\\nwere, tramples on its holiness (such as are usually called duties to God because\\nin him we think the ideal of holiness in a substance), then we give the most\\nperfect esteem to compliance with it at the sacri\\nﬁ\\nce of everything that could\\never have value for our dearest inclinations, and we\\nﬁ\\nnd our soul strengthened\\nand elevated by such an example when we can convince ourselves, in it, that\\nhuman nature is capable of so great an elevation above every incentive that\\nnature can oppose to it. Juvenal presents such an example in a climax\\nthat makes the reader feel vividly the force of the incentive present in the\\npure law of duty, as duty:\\nEsto bonus miles, tutor bonus, arbiter idem Integer; ambiguae si quando citabere\\ntestis Incertaequae rei, Phalaris licet imperet, ut sis Falsus, et admoto dictet periuria\\ntauro\\n,\\n5:159\\nSummum crede nefas animam praeferre pudori, Et propter vitam vivendi\\nperdere causas\\n.\\no\\nn\\nunerlaßliche\\no\\nBe a good soldier, a good guardian, and an incorruptible judge; if summoned to bear witness in\\nsome dubious and uncertain cause, though Phalaris\\n14\\nhimself should dictate that you perjure\\nyourself and bring his bull to move you, count it the greatest of all iniquities to prefer life to honor\\nand to lose, for the sake of living, all that makes life worth living (Juvenal\\nSatire\\n8\\n.\\n79\\n–\\n84\\n).\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n126When we can bring any\\nﬂ\\nattering thought of merit into our action, then the\\nincentive is already somewhat mixed with self-love and thus has some assis-\\ntance from the side of sensibility. But to put everything below the holiness of\\nduty alone and become aware that one\\ncan\\ndo it because our own reason\\nrecognizes this as its command and says that one\\nought\\nto do it: this is, as it\\nwere, to raise oneself altogether above the sensible world,\\np\\nand this conscious-\\nness of the law as also an incentive is inseparably combined with consciousness\\nof a power\\nruling over sensibility\\n, even if not always with effect; yet frequent\\nengagement with it and the initially minor attempts at using it give hope of its\\neffectiveness, so that gradually the greatest, but purely moral, interest in it\\nmay be produced in us.\\nAccordingly, the method takes the following course.\\nAt\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nit is only a\\nquestion of making appraisal of actions by moral laws a natural occupation\\nand, as it were, a habit accompanying all our own free actions as well as our\\nobservation of those of others, and of sharpening it by asking\\nﬁ\\nrst whether\\nthe action objectively\\nconforms with the moral law\\n, and with which law; by\\nthis, attention to such law as provides merely a\\nground\\nof obligation is\\ndistinguished from that which is in fact\\nobligatory\\n(\\nleges obligandi a legibus\\nobligantibus\\n)\\nq\\n(e.g., the law of what the\\nneed\\nof human beings requires of me\\nas contrasted with what their\\nright\\nrequires, the latter of which prescribes\\nessential duties whereas the forme\\nr prescribes only nonessential\\nr\\nduties),\\nand thus one teaches how to distinguish different duties that come together\\nin an action. The other point to which attention must be directed is the\\nquestion whether the action was also done (subjectively)\\nfor the sake of the\\nmoral law\\n, so that it has not only moral correctness as a deed but also moral\\nworth as a disposition by its maxim. No\\nw, there is no doubt that this exercise\\nand the consciousness of a cultivatio\\nn of our reason in judging merely about\\nthe practical, arising from this exercise, must gradually produce a certain\\ninterest in reason\\n’\\ns law itself and hence in morally\\n5:160\\ngood actions. For, we\\nﬁ\\nnally come to like something the conte\\nmplation of which lets us feel a more\\nextended use of our cognitive powers,\\nwhich is especially furthered by that\\nin which we\\nﬁ\\nnd moral correctness, since only in such an order of things can\\nreason, with its capacity to determine a\\npriori in accordance with principles\\nwhat ought to be done,\\nﬁ\\nnd satisfaction. Even an observer of nature\\nﬁ\\nnally\\ncomes to like objects that at\\nﬁ\\nrst offended his senses when he discovers in\\nthem the great purposiveness of thei\\nr organization, so that his reason\\ndelights in contemplating them, and L\\neibniz spared an insect that he had\\ncarefully examined with a microscope a\\nnd replaced it on its leaf because he\\nhad found himself instructed by his view of it and had, as it were, received a\\nbene\\nﬁ\\ntf r o mi t .\\np\\nThe remainder of this sentence is grammatically dif\\nﬁ\\ncult.\\nq\\nCompare\\nThe Metaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n224\\n).\\nr\\naußerwesentliche\\nCRITIQUE OF PRACTICAL REASON\\n127But this employment of the faculty of judgment, which lets us feel our own\\ncognitive powers, is not yet interest in actions and in their morality itself. It\\nmerely brings someone to like to entertain himself with such an appraisal and\\ngives to virtue or the cast of mind according to moral laws a form of beauty,\\nwhich is admired but not yet on that account sought (\\nlaudatur et alget\\n);\\ns\\nit is the\\nsame with everything whose contemplation produces subjectively a con-\\nsciousness of the harmony of our powers of representation and in which we\\nfeel our entire cognitive faculty (understanding and imagination) strength-\\nened: it produces a satisfaction that can also be communicated to others, while\\nnevertheless the existence of the object remains indifferent to us, inasmuch as\\nthe object is viewed only as the occasion of our becoming aware of the\\ntendency of talents\\nt\\nin us which are elevated above animality. Now, however,\\nthe\\nsecond\\nexercise begins its work, namely to draw attention, in the lively\\npresentation of the moral disposition in examples, to the purity of will,\\nﬁ\\nrst\\nonly as a negative perfection of the will insofar as in an action from duty no\\nincentives of inclination have any in\\nﬂ\\nuence on it as determining grounds; by\\nthis, however, the pupil\\n’\\ns attention is\\nﬁ\\nxed on the consciousness of his\\nfreedom\\nand, although this renunciation excites an initial feeling of pain, nevertheless,\\nby its withdrawing the pupil from the constraint of even true needs, there is\\nmade known to him at the same time a deliverance from the manifold dissat-\\nisfaction in which all those needs entangle him and his\\n5:161\\nmind is made receptive\\nto the feeling of satisfaction from other sources. The heart is freed and relieved\\nof a burden that always secretly presses upon it, when in pure moral reso-\\nlutions, examples of which are set before him, there is revealed to the human\\nbeing an inner capacity not otherwise correctly known by himself, the\\ninner\\nfreedom\\nto release himself from the impetuous importunity of inclinations so\\nthat none of them, not even the dearest, has any in\\nﬂ\\nuence on a resolution for\\nwhich we are now to make use of our reason. In a case where\\nI alone\\nknow that\\nthe wrong is on my side and, although a free confession of it and an offer of\\nsatisfaction are strongly opposed by vanity, sel\\nﬁ\\nshness, and even an otherwise\\nnot illegitimate antipathy to him whose right I have detracted from, I am\\nnevertheless able to disregard all these considerations; and this includes\\nconsciousness of an independence from inclinations and from circumstances\\nand of the possibility of being suf\\nﬁ\\ncient to myself, which is salutary to me in\\ngeneral, in other respects as well. And now the law of duty, through the\\npositive worth that observance of it lets us feel,\\nﬁ\\nnds easier access through the\\nrespect for ourselves\\nin the consciousness of our freedom. When this is well\\nestablished, when a human being dreads nothing more than to\\nﬁ\\nnd, on self-\\nexamination, that he is worthless and contemptible in his own eyes, then every\\ngood moral disposition can be grafted onto it, because this is the best, and\\ns\\n[Honesty] is praised and starves (Juvenal\\nSatire\\n1\\n.\\n74\\n).\\nt\\nAnlage der Talente\\nIMMANUEL KANT\\n128indeed the sole, guard to prevent ignoble and corrupting impulses from\\nbreaking into the mind.\\nI have intended, here, only to point out the most general maxims of the\\ndoctrine of the method of moral cultivation and exercise.

Flatt is, again, the\\n“\\nreviewer from Tübingen\\n”\\nreferred to in\\nThe\\nMetaphysics of Morals\\n(\\n6\\n:\\n207\\n). The review was in the spirit of Gottlieb August\\nTittel\\n’\\ns\\nÜber Herrn Kants Moralreform\\n(\\n1786\\n), which asked\\n“\\nIs the entire Kantian\\nreform of moral philosophy to limit itself to a new formula?\\n”\\nTittel made further\\ncriticisms relevant to Kant\\n’\\ns remarks in the Preface to the\\nCritique of Practical\\nReason\\n, e.g., that a proposition\\n“\\nso common and well known\\n”\\ncould be made so\\nobscure, requiring one to put a human being in two worlds, and censured his\\nterminology, in effect charging him with (in Kant\\n’\\ns words)\\n“\\nputting new patches\\non an old garment\\n”\\n(\\n10\\n). In a letter to Kant of June\\n11\\n,\\n1786\\n, the editor of the\\nBerlinische Monatsschrift\\n, Johann Erich Biester, referred to Tittel as\\n“\\nthe feeble\\nshadow of a feeble (F)eder\\n”\\n(\\n10\\n:\\n457\\n) and suggested that their attacks were not\\nsuf\\nﬁ\\nciently important to warrant a reply. On Feder, see notes\\n3\\nand\\n6\\n.\\n2\\nThe reviewer was H. A. Pistorius in\\nAllgemeine deutsche Bibliothek.\\nAlthough the\\nreview was anonymous, a letter to Kant from Daniel Jenisch of May\\n14\\n,\\n1787\\n,\\nidenti\\nﬁ\\ned Pistorius as the author (AK\\n10\\n:\\n486\\n). The section of the\\nCritique\\nentitled\\n“\\nOn the Concept of an Object of Pure Practical Reason\\n”\\nis Kant\\n’\\ns reply to this\\nparticular concern of Pistorius. Kant\\n’\\ns primary concern, however, is with the\\nmore fundamental problem, raised by Pistorius, about the consistency of theo-\\nretical and practical reason (AK\\n5\\n:\\n8\\n).\\n3\\nKant\\n’\\ns reference is to Johann Georg Feder, the author of\\nÜber Raum und\\nCaußalität zur Prüfung der Kantischen Philosophie\\n, Göttingen,\\n1789\\n. In a letter\\nof June\\n25\\n,\\n1787\\n, to Christian Gottfried Schutz, Kant says that he expects to send\\nhis\\nCritique of Practical Reason\\nto the publisher the following week and adds\\n“\\nthis\\nwill be better than any controversy with Feder and Abel (the\\nﬁ\\nrst of whom\\nmaintains that there is no a priori cognition at all)\\n”\\n(\\n10\\n:\\n490\\n).\\n4\\nIn his\\nEnquiry concerning Human Understanding\\n, Section IV, Hume maintains\\nthat the propositions of mathematics are, in Kant\\n’\\ns terms, analytic. In\\nA Treatise\\nof Human Nature\\nI, III, I, he had considered the propositions of geometry\\nsynthetic and empirical. However, Kant apparently had no direct access to the\\nTreatise.\\n5\\nWilliam Cheselden (\\n1688\\n–\\n1752\\n) reported his patient\\n’\\ns reaction to an operation that\\nrestored his vision in\\nPhilosophical Transactions\\n,\\n1728\\n. His report could have become\\nknown to Kant either through Kästner\\n’\\ns\\nVollständigem Lehrbegriff der Optik\\nof\\n1755\\nor through its repetition by Herder in\\n1769\\n.\\n6\\nThis note, like the comparable note in the\\nProlegomena to Any Future Metaphysics\\n(\\n4\\n:\\n375\\nn), is apparently directed against Feder, the editor who had revised\\nChristian Garve\\n’\\ns review of the\\nCritique of Pure Reason.\\nThis review, which\\nappeared in the supplement to the\\nGöttingische gelehrte Anzeigen\\nof January\\n19\\n,\\n1782\\n, was cited in the\\nProlegomena\\nas\\n“\\nA Specimen of a Judgment of the Critique\\nprior to its Examination\\n”\\n(\\n4\\n:\\n372\\n–\\n80\\n).\\n7\\nEpicurus and the Stoics are discussed elsewhere in the\\nCritique\\n,e s p e c i a l l yi n\\nthe Dialectic.
